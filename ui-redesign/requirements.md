2. **Workflow Management**
   - Discover available workflows
   - Configure workflow parameters
   - Execute workflows with real-time feedback
   - Access historical workflow executions
   - View detailed workflow results

3. **System Status**
   - View agent availability/health
   - Monitor system performance
   - Review important notifications/alerts

## Primary User Journeys

1. **New User Journey**
   - Discover available capabilities
   - Understand what each agent/workflow does
   - Successfully execute first workflow
   - View and understand results

2. **Regular User Journey**
