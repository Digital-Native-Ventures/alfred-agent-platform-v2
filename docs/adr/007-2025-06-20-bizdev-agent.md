# ADR 007 – BizDev Agent Groundwork
**Date:** 2025-06-20

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Sales and partnership workflows are handled manually. A BizDev Agent should triage inbound leads, draft outreach emails, and surface MQLs to HubSpot.

## Decision
* **Service name:** `bizdev-api` (FastAPI + async OpenAI client)
* **Event bus:** NATS topic `lead.inbound` → tasks for `auto-eng`
* **Memory:** pgvector for lead snippets, Redis for short-term state
* **Endpoints:**
  * `/bizdev/qualify` – returns MQL score + suggested next step
  * `/bizdev/draft-email` – generates initial outreach email
* **Rate limits:** 10 req/min per IP (FastAPI-limiter)
* **Security:** HMAC header `X-BizDev-Signature`

## Consequences
Introduces a new container that scales independently. Requires HubSpot API creds in vault.

## Open Questions
1. HubSpot vs. Pipedrive integration priority?
2. Do we allow the agent to auto-send emails or just create drafts?

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- FastAPI service with health endpoints
- NATS integration for event handling
- pgvector storage for lead data
- Redis for session state

### Phase 2: Lead Qualification
- MQL scoring algorithm
- HubSpot integration for lead ingestion
- Email template generation

### Phase 3: Automation
- Auto-draft email responses
- Lead routing and assignment
- Analytics and reporting

## Technical Architecture


## Security Considerations
- HMAC signature validation for webhook security
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Encrypted storage of sensitive lead data
- Audit logging for compliance

## Dependencies
- OpenAI API for content generation
- HubSpot API for CRM integration
- pgvector for semantic search
- NATS for event messaging
