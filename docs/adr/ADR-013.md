# ADR-013: BizDev Architecture

## Status
Proposed

## Context
The BizDev agent requires a dedicated architecture to handle business development workflows, integrations with CRM systems (e.g., HubSpot), and sales automation processes.

## Decision
We will implement a modular BizDev architecture that:
- Integrates with HubSpot API for CRM operations
- Provides mock services for local development
- Follows the established agent pattern from Agent-Core MVP

## Consequences
- Enables rapid development of business automation workflows
- Requires new service dependencies (hubspot-mock)
- Extends the platform's capability into business operations

## Implementation
See Epic issues #401-#405 for detailed implementation plan.
