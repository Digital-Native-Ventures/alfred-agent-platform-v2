# ADR-000: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in his article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

## Consequences

- All significant architecture decisions will be documented
- ADRs will be numbered sequentially
- ADRs will be stored in the repository under `docs/adr/` or at the root for key decisions
- Old ADRs will not be deleted but marked as superseded

## Template

Future ADRs should follow this format:

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Short title of solved problem]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]

## Context
[Describe the issue motivating this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the change that we're proposing/accepting]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or harder as a result]
```
