# Git LFS Cleanup Report

**Date**: May 26, 2025
**Issue**: Repository exceeded its LFS budget

## Current LFS Usage

### Files Tracked in LFS
| File | Size | Purpose | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `gh.tar.gz` | 11 MB | GitHub CLI binary archive | Remove - already extracted |
| `mission-control.tar.gz` | 118 KB | Mission control archive | Keep - small size |
| `builder/channel_pack.zip` | 21 B | Builder channel pack | Keep - tiny |
| `docs/archive/root-cleanup-20250513/mission-control.tar.gz` | 118 KB | Archived cleanup | Keep - documentation |
| `docs/staging-area/AI_Agent_Platform_v2/alfred-pennyworth.jpg` | 69 KB | Documentation image | Keep - small |
| `docs/staging-area/AI_Agent_Platform_v2/image.png` | 278 KB | Documentation image | Keep - reasonable size |
| `services/mission-control-simplified/niche-scout-analysis.tar.gz` | 42 KB | Service analysis | Keep - small |
| `soak_midpoint_20250517T082236Z.tgz` | 1.1 KB | Soak test results | Keep - tiny |

## Cleanup Actions Performed

1. **LFS Prune**: Removed 2 untracked objects (71 MB freed)
2. **Identified unnecessary file**: `gh.tar.gz` (11 MB) - GitHub CLI already extracted

## Recommended Actions

1. Remove `gh.tar.gz` from LFS tracking since we have the extracted directory
2. Update `.gitattributes` to properly configure LFS tracking
3. Consider moving large archives to external storage if they grow

## Storage Savings
- Immediate: 71 MB from pruning
- Potential: 11 MB from removing gh.tar.gz
- Total potential savings: 82 MB
