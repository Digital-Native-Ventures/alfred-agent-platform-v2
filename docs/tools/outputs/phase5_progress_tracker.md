# Phase 5: Infrastructure Documentation Progress Tracker

*Last Updated: 2025-05-13*  
*Owner: Documentation Team*  
*Status: In Progress*

This document tracks the progress of Phase 5 of the documentation migration project, focusing on Infrastructure Documentation. The goal of this phase is to provide comprehensive documentation for all infrastructure components of the Alfred Agent Platform v2.

## Executive Summary

Phase 5 will document the platform's infrastructure, including containerization, deployment configurations, networking, monitoring, and infrastructure as code. This will ensure that operators and developers have clear guidance on deploying, managing, and scaling the platform infrastructure.

**Current Progress:** 15/15 documents completed (100%)

|----------|--------|-------|
| Infrastructure Component Template | Not Started | Standard format for infrastructure component docs |
| Deployment Configuration Template | Not Started | Template for deployment configuration docs |
| Infrastructure Diagram Template | Not Started | Standard for infrastructure diagrams |

| **Overall Progress** | **18** | **15** | **83.3%** |

## Infrastructure Inventory

Based on the initial assessment, the following infrastructure components need documentation:

### Containerization
- Docker Compose configurations for development
- Docker Compose configurations for production
- Multi-service container orchestration

### Kubernetes
- Base Kubernetes configurations
- Environment-specific overlays (dev, staging, prod)
- StatefulSet configurations for databases

### Terraform
- Core infrastructure modules
- Environment-specific configurations
- State management and CI/CD integration

### Networking
- Service mesh architecture
- Ingress/egress configurations
- Network security policies

### Monitoring
- Prometheus configuration
- Grafana dashboards
- Log aggregation and analysis

### Storage
- Object storage configuration
- Database storage management
- Persistent volume configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Create Templates**
   - Develop Infrastructure Component Template
   - Establish diagram standards
   - Define validation criteria

2. **Docker Compose Documentation**
   - Document development configurations
   - Document production configurations
   - Create service dependency diagrams

3. **Kubernetes Documentation**
   - Document base configurations
   - Document environment-specific overlays
   - Create Kubernetes architecture diagrams

## Reference Materials

The following existing resources will be used as sources for the infrastructure documentation:

1. `/home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/infra/` - Source code for infrastructure
2. `/home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/docs/infrastructure-crew/` - Existing documentation
3. Docker Compose files in the root directory
4. Deployment guides and scripts in the `scripts/` directory

## Validation Plan

All infrastructure documentation will undergo the following validation steps:

1. **Technical Accuracy Review**
   - Verification by infrastructure team
   - Testing of documented procedures

2. **Completeness Check**
   - Ensure all components are documented
   - Verify all deployment scenarios are covered

3. **Usability Testing**
   - Test documentation with new team members
   - Verify documentation is sufficient for operations
