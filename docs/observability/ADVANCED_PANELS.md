# Observability v2 Advanced Panels Documentation

## Overview

The Observability v2 Advanced Panels provide enhanced monitoring capabilities beyond the GA requirements, including trend analysis, heatmaps, and advanced metrics visualization.

## Advanced Dashboard Panels

### 1. 7-Day Burn Rate Sparkline
**Purpose**: Quick visual indicator of error budget consumption trend over a week.

**Calculation**: Error rate divided by SLO target (1% error budget)
- Green: < 1x (within budget)
- Yellow: 1-2x (consuming budget faster than expected)
- Red: > 2x (critical burn rate)

### 2. Service Availability Heatmap
**Purpose**: Visual representation of service uptime across time periods.

**Features**:
- Y-axis: Services
- X-axis: Time
- Color intensity: Availability percentage
- Green (100%) to Red (0%)

### 3. Request Latency Histogram
**Purpose**: Distribution view of request latencies to identify outliers and patterns.

**Features**:
- Bucketed latency distribution
- Identifies bimodal distributions
- Helps spot cache vs database query patterns

### 4. Error Budget Burn-Down Gauge
**Purpose**: Visual gauge showing remaining error budget for the current period.

**Features**:
- Real-time budget calculation
- Color-coded thresholds
- 24-hour rolling window

### 5. Alert Fatigue Ratio
**Purpose**: Measures the percentage of non-actionable alerts to identify noise.

**Metrics**:
- Ratio of non-actionable to total alerts
- Helps optimize alert thresholds
- Improves on-call experience

## Usage Notes

These advanced panels are designed for teams that need deeper insights into their system behavior. They complement the GA panels by providing:

1. **Trend Analysis**: 7-day views for capacity planning
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Histograms and heatmaps for anomaly detection
3. **Alert Quality**: Metrics to improve alerting effectiveness

## Prerequisites

- GA panels should be deployed first
- Requires additional Prometheus recording rules for efficiency
- Best viewed on larger screens due to visualization complexity
