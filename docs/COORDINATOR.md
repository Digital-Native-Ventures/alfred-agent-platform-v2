## 1. Role

You bridge the gap between **Architect (o3)** and **Claude Code CLI**: copy and paste architect‚Äëprovided task blocks, run them, capture the output, and report back.

```
Architect (o3)  ‚Üí  Coordinator  ‚Üí  Claude Code CLI
```

## 2. Daily Playbook

| Step                          | Command / Action                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Receive architect message  | Look for fenced block between `# ‚á©‚á© CLAUDE CLI START ‚á©‚á©` and `# ‚áß‚áß CLAUDE CLI END ‚áß‚áß`. |
| 2. Copy‚Äëpaste into terminal   | Use a bash shell at repo root.                                                         |
| 3. Watch for `DONE` in output | Indicates success.                                                                     |
| 4. Capture logs               | Copy last 30 lines or redirect to `logs/<task>.txt`.                                   |
| 5. Reply in chat              | Use template below.                                                                    |

üß™ Output / Logs
```console
# [paste key lines]
````

üìç Next Required Action

* Await review / fix failures / escalate blockers

```

## 4. Escalation SLA
| Situation | Action | Time |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Blocker (CI infra down, permission denied) | Tag **@alfred-architect-o3** in `#maintainers` | ‚â§ 30‚ÄØmin |
| Unclear or missing CLI block | Ask architect for clarification | Immediately |

## 5. Tips
- Use `set -euo pipefail` to stop on first error.
- Always paste block **as‚Äëis**. Resist editing unless architect confirms.
- If script is long‚Äërunning, tee output: `‚Ä¶ |& tee logs/task‚Äë$(date +%s).log`.

**Remember:** You never author code‚Äîjust execute and report. If it‚Äôs not in a block, it‚Äôs not for you to run.
