# Quarterly Housekeeping Process

This document outlines the quarterly housekeeping process for the Alfred Agent Platform. This process ensures that our platform remains healthy, up-to-date, and well-maintained over time.

## Schedule

The quarterly housekeeping process should be performed in the first two weeks of each quarter:
- Q1: January 1-15
- Q2: April 1-15
- Q3: July 1-15
- Q4: October 1-15

## Process Owner

The DevOps team is responsible for coordinating the quarterly housekeeping process. However, all teams are expected to participate in the process for their respective areas of ownership.

## Housekeeping Tasks

### 1. Dependency Updates

- [ ] Upgrade healthcheck binary to the latest version using `./scripts/bump-healthcheck.sh <new-version>`
- [ ] Update all Python dependencies in requirements files
- [ ] Update Docker base images to latest stable versions
- [ ] Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies using `safety check` or similar tools
- [ ] Update Node.js dependencies in package.json files

### 2. Infrastructure Maintenance

- [ ] Validate all monitoring configurations
- [ ] Prune unused Docker volumes and images
- [ ] Optimize Docker images for size and security
- [ ] Check for resource usage patterns and adjust resource allocations if needed
- [ ] Validate all backup and recovery procedures

### 3. Monitoring and Metrics

- [ ] Review and prune unused Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Validate metric collection for all services
- [ ] Verify alerting rules and thresholds
- [ ] Update dashboards with any new metrics
- [ ] Test monitoring system failover
- [ ] Run the Phase-0 validation script on all branches to ensure metrics are still working

### 4. Documentation

- [ ] Update README.md with any new information
- [ ] Review and update CONTRIBUTING.md if needed
- [ ] Update deprecated documentation
- [ ] Document any new patterns or best practices
- [ ] Ensure all new services have proper documentation

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

- [ ] Run integration tests on all services
- [ ] Execute performance tests and compare with previous quarters
- [ ] Verify CI/CD pipeline functionality
- [ ] Update test fixtures and mocks if needed
- [ ] Add tests for new functionality

### 6. Code Quality

- [ ] Run linting across the codebase
- [ ] Check for TODO comments and address them
- [ ] Review code coverage and improve if necessary
- [ ] Remove deprecated code
- [ ] Refactor common patterns into shared libraries

## Execution Process

1. Create a housekeeping issue in GitHub Projects board at the beginning of the quarter
2. DevOps team creates sub-tasks for each team based on the housekeeping checklist
3. Teams complete their assigned tasks within the first two weeks of the quarter
4. DevOps team reviews and verifies all completed tasks
5. Create a consolidated PR with all housekeeping changes
6. Merge the PR after approval from all team leads
7. Tag the repository with a housekeeping release: `v*.*.0-housekeeping-YYYYQ#`
8. Document the completed housekeeping process in the wiki

## Metrics for Success

Track the following metrics to measure the success of the housekeeping process:

- Number of dependency updates
- Number of security vulnerabilities addressed
- Reduction in Docker image sizes
- Improved test coverage
- Number of deprecated components removed
- Number of optimizations implemented

## Example Schedule for Q3 2025

| Date | Activity |
|------|----------|
| July 1 | Create housekeeping issue and sub-tasks |
| July 1-3 | Dependency updates |
| July 4-6 | Infrastructure maintenance |
| July 7-9 | Monitoring and metrics |
| July 10-12 | Documentation updates |
| July 13-14 | Testing and code quality |
| July 15 | Final review and PR creation |
| July 16 | PR merge and tag release |

## Automation

Whenever possible, automate the housekeeping process using scripts. The following scripts are available:

- `./scripts/bump-healthcheck.sh` - Updates the healthcheck binary version
- `./scripts/backup-dashboards.sh` - Creates backups of Grafana dashboards
- `./scripts/lint-metrics-format.sh` - Validates metrics format
- `./scripts/test-metrics-ports.sh` - Tests metrics endpoints

Additional automation should be added over time to reduce the manual effort required for housekeeping.
