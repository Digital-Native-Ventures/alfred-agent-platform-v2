- [ ] Notification sent to stakeholders
- [ ] On-call personnel assigned and alerted
- [ ] Rollback point identified and communicated
- [ ] Deployment team assembled
- [ ] Deployment credentials/access verified

### Deployment Steps

- [ ] Deploy infrastructure changes using Terraform
  ```bash
  cd infra/terraform/environments/prod
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

- [ ] Verify infrastructure changes
  ```bash
  terraform state list
  terraform output
  ```

- [ ] Deploy Kubernetes secrets
  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic alfred-secrets \
    --from-literal=database-url=$DATABASE_URL \
    --from-literal=openai-api-key=$OPENAI_API_KEY \
    --from-literal=slack-bot-token=$SLACK_BOT_TOKEN
  ```

- [ ] Apply database migrations (if any)
  ```bash
  ./scripts/migrate-database.sh
  ```

- [ ] Deploy Kubernetes manifests
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -k infra/k8s/overlays/prod
  ```

- [ ] Verify deployment status
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  kubectl get services
  kubectl get deployments
  ```

- [ ] Monitor rollout status
  ```bash
  kubectl rollout status deployment/alfred-bot
  kubectl rollout status deployment/mission-control
  kubectl rollout status deployment/architect-apiligence
  kubectl rollout status deployment/financial-tax
  kubectl rollout status deployment/legal-compliance
  ```

### Canary Deployment (if applicable)

- [ ] Deploy canary version (10% of traffic)
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f infra/k8s/overlays/prod/canary
  ```

- [ ] Monitor canary metrics for 15 minutes
- [ ] Compare error rates with stable version
- [ ] Compare latency with stable version
- [ ] If metrics acceptable, proceed with full deployment
- [ ] If metrics unacceptable, rollback canary

## Post-Deployment Phase

### Verification

- [ ] All pods are running and ready
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -o wide | grep -v "Running\|Completed"
  ```

- [ ] Service endpoints accessible
  ```bash
  for svc in $(kubectl get svc -o name); do
    kubectl describe $svc | grep Endpoints
  done
  ```

- [ ] Health check endpoints return success
  ```bash
  curl -s https://<service-url>/health/live | grep "ok"
  curl -s https://<service-url>/health/ready | grep "ok"
  ```

- [ ] Metrics endpoints exposed and reporting
  ```bash
  curl -s https://<service-url>/health/metrics
  ```

- [ ] Application logs show normal operation
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app=alfred-bot --tail=100
  ```

- [ ] No errors in application logs
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app=alfred-bot | grep -i error
  ```

- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] Message queues processing normally
- [ ] Basic functionality test cases executed

### Performance Validation

- [ ] CPU utilization within expected range
  ```bash
  kubectl top pods
  ```

- [ ] Memory utilization within expected range
  ```bash
  kubectl top pods
  ```

- [ ] Request latency within SLO
- [ ] Error rates within SLO
- [ ] Database query performance acceptable
- [ ] Connection pool utilization normal
- [ ] No resource bottlenecks identified

### Security Validation

- [ ] No unapproved external network access
- [ ] Network policies enforced correctly
- [ ] Secrets properly mounted and accessible
- [ ] Logging does not contain sensitive information
- [ ] Mutual TLS correctly configured (if applicable)
- [ ] Pod security policies enforced

### Final Steps

- [ ] Notify stakeholders of successful deployment
- [ ] Update status page or announcement channels
- [ ] Document any issues encountered during deployment
- [ ] Schedule post-deployment review meeting
- [ ] Update deployment statistics and metrics
- [ ] Archive deployment logs
- [ ] Close deployment ticket/issue

## Rollback Procedures

### Triggering Rollback

Rollback should be triggered if any of the following conditions are met:

- Critical functionality not working
- Error rate exceeds 1% for more than 5 minutes
- Latency exceeds 500ms p95 for more than 5 minutes
- Security vulnerability discovered in deployed version
- Database migration failed or caused data corruption
- Critical user-facing bug discovered

### Application Rollback Steps

1. Identify the last known good version:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment/<service-name>
   ```

2. Update image tags in Kubernetes manifests:
   ```bash
   kubectl set image deployment/<service-name> <container-name>=<registry>/<image>:<previous-tag>
   ```

3. Apply the rollback:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/<service-name>
   ```

4. Verify rollback status:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout status deployment/<service-name>
   ```

5. Verify application functionality after rollback

### Infrastructure Rollback Steps

1. Revert to the previous Terraform state:
   ```bash
   cd infra/terraform/environments/prod
   terraform plan -target=<problematic-resource> -out=rollback.plan
   terraform apply rollback.plan
   ```

2. Verify infrastructure state after rollback

### Database Rollback Steps

1. Stop affected services:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment/<service-name> --replicas=0
   ```

2. Restore database from backup:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/restore-database.sh <backup-name>
   ```

3. Restart services:
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment/<service-name> --replicas=<original-count>
   ```

4. Verify database state and connectivity
