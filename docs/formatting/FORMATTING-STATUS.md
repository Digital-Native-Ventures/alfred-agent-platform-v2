# Black Formatting Status

## Current Status

The `apply-black-format` branch contains Black formatting applied to 98 Python files in the project. 
These formatting changes include:

- Reordering imports (generally alphabetically with standard library first)
- Adjusting line breaks and whitespace
- Standardizing code style (trailing commas, quotes, etc.)
- Setting line length to 100 characters (as specified in pyproject.toml)

## Remaining Work

There are several Python files that still need Black formatting applied:

1. Files in `agents/social_intel/` directory
2. Files in `libs/observability/` directory
3. Several Python files in service directories (especially `services/social-intel/` and `services/model-router/`)
4. Some node_modules Python files (these should probably be excluded from formatting)

## Implementation Issues

Currently, we're experiencing issues with running Black directly:

1. Python environment/pip setup issues prevent direct installation of Black
2. We have two scripts (`apply-black.sh` and `format-with-black.sh`) that attempt to install and run Black
3. CI pipeline is configured to check Black formatting but special exemptions are added for the Black formatting PR

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Fix Python environment/pip setup to allow proper installation of Black
2. Run the existing Black formatting script on all remaining Python files
3. Create a PR to merge these changes
4. Update CI pipeline to enforce Black formatting going forward

## Reference 

The Black configuration is in pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 100
target-version = ['py311']
include = '\.pyi?$'
```

The CI configuration in `.github/workflows/metrics-ci-pipeline.yml` includes special handling for formatting PRs.
