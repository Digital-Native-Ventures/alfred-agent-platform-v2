## Technical Approach

We've implemented a standardized health check system across all services with the following features:

1. **Common Endpoints**:
   - `/health`: Detailed service health information
   - `/healthz`: Simple health probe
   - `/metrics`: Prometheus metrics

2. **Implementation Methods**:
   - **Binary-based**: Using the healthcheck binary (v0.4.0) for containerized services
   - **Direct implementation**: For services with application code access

3. **Metrics Export**:
   - All services expose metrics on port 9091 (container internal)
   - Each service has a dedicated host port mapping (9091-9100)
   - Standard Prometheus labels added

4. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Standardized healthcheck commands
   - Consistent timing parameters
   - Multi-stage builds to include healthcheck binary

## Standardized Port Mapping

We've established a consistent port mapping scheme for metrics:

| Service | Container Port | Host Port |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| agent-core | 9091 | 9091 |
| alfred-bot | 9091 | 9095 |
| model-registry | 9091 | 9093 |
| model-router | 9091 | 9094 |
| agent-financial | 9091 | 9096 |
| agent-legal | 9091 | 9097 |
| ui-chat | 9091 | 9098 |
| agent-rag | 9091 | 9099 |
| ui-admin | 9091 | 9100 |

## Testing Tools

We've created tools to validate the health check implementation:

1. **[verify-health-endpoints.sh](./scripts/healthcheck/verify-health-endpoints.sh)**: Automated script to check all endpoints
2. **[update-prometheus-config.sh](./scripts/healthcheck/update-prometheus-config.sh)**: Script to update Prometheus configuration

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **UI Admin Implementation Complete**:
   - Added Express.js health routes and metrics server
   - Updated docker-compose.yml with proper configuration
   - Incorporated healthcheck binary for metrics export

2. **Complete Validation Testing**:
   - Test all services using the verify-health-endpoints.sh script
   - Verify Prometheus metrics collection
   - Test dependency tracking and degradation scenarios

3. **Create Grafana Dashboard**:
   - Build a service health dashboard in Grafana
   - Add alerts for service degradation
   - Create visualization for dependency mapping

4. **Operational Documentation**:
   - Add health check troubleshooting to runbooks
   - Create operations documentation for monitoring

## Key Benefits

The standardized health check implementation provides:

1. **Unified Monitoring**: All services are monitored using the same approach and tools
2. **Dependency Visibility**: Clear tracking of service dependencies
3. **Metrics Integration**: Standard Prometheus metrics across all services
4. **Resilience Awareness**: Services can report degraded status before complete failure

## Conclusion

The health check standardization project has successfully implemented a consistent health monitoring approach across the Alfred Agent Platform v2. All core services now have a comprehensive health monitoring system that enables better operational visibility and proactive issue detection. The next phase will focus on extending this implementation to infrastructure services as outlined in the NEXT_SERVICES_FOR_HEALTHCHECK.md document.
