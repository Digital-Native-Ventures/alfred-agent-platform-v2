# Health Check Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of health checks and metrics collection for the Alfred Agent Platform v2, with a focus on database services.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Database Metrics Exporters**:
   - Created and deployed metrics exporters for all database services:
     - db-auth-metrics
     - db-api-metrics
     - db-admin-metrics
     - db-realtime-metrics
     - db-storage-metrics (reconfigured to work with mock-storage)

2. **Port Conflict Resolution**:
   - Resolved port conflicts by moving metrics exporters to a new port range:
     - Changed from 9110-9114 to 9120-9124
   - Updated all configurations to use the new port mappings

3. **Prometheus Configuration Cleanup**:
   - Completely rewrote the Prometheus configuration to:
     - Remove obsolete container names
     - Organize scrape targets by service category
     - Ensure all targets match running containers
     - Standardize job naming to match service names

4. **Mock Storage Implementation**:
   - Created a mock storage service to replace the problematic db-storage service
   - Implemented basic API endpoints and health checks
   - Integrated with the metrics collection system

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created detailed documentation for all changes:
     - DB_STORAGE_FIXES.md - Explanation of the db-storage issues
     - MOCK_STORAGE_IMPLEMENTATION.md - Details of the mock storage solution
     - HEALTH_CHECK_SUMMARY.md - Overview of the health check implementation

## Testing and Verification

All services have been tested and verified:

1. **Health Endpoints**: 
   - Confirmed that each service exposes a working health endpoint
   - Verified that health checks return appropriate status codes

2. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Confirmed that all metrics exporters collect and expose service metrics
   - Verified that Prometheus can scrape all metrics endpoints

3. **Prometheus Integration**:
   - Verified that all services appear as targets in Prometheus
   - Confirmed that metrics are correctly labeled and categorized

## Next Steps

1. **Grafana Dashboards**:
   - Create dashboards for database service metrics
   - Set up alerts for service health

2. **Long-term Storage Solution**:
   - Investigate and resolve the migration issues with the original db-storage service
   - Implement a proper persistent storage solution

3. **Standardize Health Checks**:
   - Extend the health check standard to all remaining services
   - Ensure consistent health check response formats across services

## Technical Details

### Port Mapping

| Service | Container Port | Host Port |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| db-auth-metrics | 9091 | 9120 |
| db-api-metrics | 9091 | 9121 |
| db-admin-metrics | 9091 | 9122 |
| db-realtime-metrics | 9091 | 9123 |
| db-storage-metrics | 9091 | 9124 |

### Health Check Endpoints

All services expose health endpoints following one of these patterns:
- `/health` - Standard HTTP health check
- `/healthz` - Kubernetes-style health check
- `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint
