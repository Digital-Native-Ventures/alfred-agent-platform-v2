# Health Check Implementation Completion

This document summarizes the completed implementation of standardized health checks for the Alfred Agent Platform v2.

## Implemented Features

1. **Standardized Health Endpoints**
   - All services now expose `/health`, `/healthz`, and `/metrics` endpoints
   - Consistent response format with status and dependency information
   - Unified metrics collection on port 9091

2. **Infrastructure Service Health Wrappers**
   - Redis now has a FastAPI-based health wrapper
   - PubSub emulator now has a FastAPI-based health wrapper
   - Both expose standard health endpoints and metrics

3. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Updated all service health check commands to use `curl -f http://localhost:<PORT>/health` instead of the non-existent `healthcheck` binary
   - Fixed TCP-based health checks to use `curl` or `nc` for proper connectivity testing
   - Standard timing parameters: 30s interval, 20s timeout, 5 retries, 45s start period
   - Added dependency configuration for proper service startup order

4. **Prometheus Integration**
   - Created script to automatically update Prometheus configuration
   - Services are discovered based on port 9091 exposure
   - Unified `service_health` job for consistent metrics collection
   - Backwards compatibility with existing specialized jobs

5. **Scripts and Tools**
   - `audit-health-binary.sh`: Identifies legacy health checks
   - `bulk-update-health-binary.sh`: Updates Dockerfiles to v0.4.0 standard
   - `ensure-metrics-exported.sh`: Verifies metrics endpoints
   - `fix-health-endpoints.sh`: Standardizes health endpoint implementations
   - `run-full-healthcheck.sh`: Performs comprehensive health check
   - `update-prometheus-config.sh`: Updates Prometheus configuration

## Implementation Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability**
   - Proper dependency tracking between services
   - Graceful degradation with status reporting
   - Better error handling with detailed status reports

2. **Enhanced Observability**
   - Consistent metrics across all services
   - Automatic service discovery in Prometheus
   - Dependency graphs for troubleshooting

3. **Standardized Patterns**
   - Consistent response formats
   - Unified implementation approach
   - Common port (9091) for metrics across all services

4. **Operational Improvements**
   - Enhanced service startup sequencing
   - Better error reporting
   - Streamlined health check validation

## Validation Process

To validate the implementation:

1. **Test Individual Services**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9091/health   # Detailed health information
   curl http://localhost:9091/healthz  # Simple health probe
   curl http://localhost:9091/metrics  # Prometheus metrics
   ```

2. **Run Full Health Check**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/healthcheck/run-full-healthcheck.sh
   ```

3. **Verify Prometheus Integration**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/healthcheck/update-prometheus-config.sh
   docker-compose restart prometheus
   ```

4. **Check Dashboard**
   Access Grafana at http://localhost:3000 and view the service health dashboard.

## Future Work

1. Create Grafana dashboards to visualize service health
2. Add alerting rules for degraded services
3. Implement auto-recovery for unhealthy services
4. Add service-level objectives (SLOs) based on health metrics
5. Enhance documentation with troubleshooting guides for common failure modes
6. Add health check details to each service's documentation
7. Test comprehensive health check implementation in CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

All services now follow a standardized health check implementation, improving the platform's reliability, observability, and operational efficiency. The health check system provides a foundation for advanced monitoring capabilities and enables better troubleshooting during outages or degraded performance.
