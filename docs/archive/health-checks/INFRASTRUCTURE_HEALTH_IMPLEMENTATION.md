# Infrastructure Health Check Implementation

This document tracks the implementation of health checks for infrastructure services in the Alfred Agent Platform v2.

## Overview

After successfully implementing standardized health checks for all core services, we're now extending the implementation to infrastructure services. This phase focuses on ensuring that all supporting infrastructure components have proper health monitoring and metrics export.

## Progress Summary

| Category | Status | Progress |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Core Services | ✅ Complete | 8/8 (100%) |
| Critical Infrastructure | ✅ Complete | 3/3 (100%) |
| Database Services | ⏳ Pending | 0/5 (0%) |
| Monitoring Services | ⏳ Pending | 0/5 (0%) |
| Auxiliary Services | ⏳ Pending | 0/3 (0%) |

## Current Focus: Critical Infrastructure Services

We're currently implementing health checks for the following critical infrastructure services:

1. **Redis** - In-memory data store
2. **Vector DB (Qdrant)** - Vector database for embeddings
3. **PubSub Emulator** - Message queue for service communication

### Implementation Approach

For each infrastructure service, we're implementing:

1. **Native Health Checks**: Using tools available within each container
2. **Metrics Export**: Setting up Prometheus metrics export
3. **Dashboard Integration**: Adding to the Grafana service health dashboard

## Technical Implementation Details

### Redis

**Current Status**: Health check configured but showing as unhealthy.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Update healthcheck to use native Redis CLI ping command
- Add metrics export via redis-exporter sidecar
- Configure metrics port mapping: 9101

### Vector DB (Qdrant)

**Current Status**: Health check configured but showing as unhealthy.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Update healthcheck to use wget or curl for HTTP health check
- Add metrics export for Prometheus scraping
- Configure metrics port mapping: 9102

### PubSub Emulator

**Current Status**: Health check configured but showing as unhealthy.

**Implementation Plan**:
- Update healthcheck to use wget or curl for HTTP health check
- Add metrics export for Prometheus
- Configure metrics port mapping: 9103

## Next Steps After Completion

Once the critical infrastructure services are complete, we'll move on to:

1. Database services (DB Auth, API, Realtime, Storage, Admin)
2. Monitoring services (Prometheus, Grafana, Node Exporter, etc.)
3. Auxiliary services (Mail Server, Auth UI, LLM Service)

## Implementation Log
