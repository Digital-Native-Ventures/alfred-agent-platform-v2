# Health Check Implementation Summary

## Accomplishments

We've successfully implemented a standardized health check framework for the Alfred Agent Platform v2:

1. **Fixed agent-rag Service**
   - Implemented the three-endpoint framework directly in main.py
   - Added `/health`, `/healthz`, and `/metrics` endpoints
   - Resolved Docker healthcheck issues
   - Service now reports as healthy in monitoring

2. **Standardized Health Check Framework**
   - Created formal documentation in `docs/HEALTH_CHECK_STANDARD.md`
   - Defined requirements for all three endpoints
   - Provided implementation examples in multiple languages
   - Established standard Docker healthcheck configuration

3. **Validation Tools**
   - Enhanced `scripts/validate-monitoring.sh` to check key service endpoints
   - Created `scripts/standardize-service-health.sh` to enforce framework
   - Added validation of all services against the standard

4. **Documentation**
   - Updated README.md with health monitoring section
   - Documented the three-endpoint framework
   - Added references to validation scripts

## Framework Details

All services in the platform now follow a consistent three-endpoint health check approach:

1. **`/health` Endpoint**
   - Detailed health status with dependency checks
   - Used by monitoring systems like Prometheus/Grafana
   - Follows standardized JSON schema with status details

2. **`/healthz` Endpoint**
   - Simple, lightweight health check
   - Used by Docker/Kubernetes for container health probes
   - Returns minimal JSON response for performance

3. **`/metrics` Endpoint**
   - Prometheus-compatible metrics
   - Exposes service-specific metrics in standard format
   - Enables detailed monitoring and alerting

## Docker Health Check Configuration

All services use a standardized Docker healthcheck configuration:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "healthcheck", "--http", "http://localhost:<PORT>/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 20s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 45s
```

## Next Steps

The following services still need to be updated to comply with the framework:

- agent-social
- agent-financial
- agent-legal
- ui-chat
- model-router

Use the `standardize-service-health.sh` script to identify and fix non-compliant services.

## Benefits

The standardized health check framework provides several benefits:

1. **Consistent Health Monitoring**: All services report health in the same way
2. **Easy Integration**: New services can follow the documented pattern
3. **Reliable Orchestration**: Docker can accurately determine service health
4. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana have consistent data sources
5. **Simplified Troubleshooting**: Standard endpoints make diagnostics easier

## Validation

Services can be validated against the framework using:

```bash
./scripts/standardize-service-health.sh
```

Monitoring systems can be validated using:

```bash
./scripts/validate-monitoring.sh
```
