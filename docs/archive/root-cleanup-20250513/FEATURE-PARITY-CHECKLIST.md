## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Focus (Week 1-2):**
   - Port gradient styling to agent-orchestrator
   - Implement UI animations
   - Create shared design tokens

2. **Short-term Goals (Week 3-4):**
   - Complete workflow feature implementations
   - Standardize API client
   - Implement visualization components

3. **Mid-term Goals (Week 5-8):**
   - Complete all high-priority items
   - Begin medium-priority implementation
   - Set up comprehensive testing

4. **Updates:**
   - This document should be updated weekly to track progress
   - Add new features as they are identified
   - Update status as features are implemented
