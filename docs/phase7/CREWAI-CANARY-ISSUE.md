## Canary Status: COMPLETED ✅

The 24-hour canary monitoring period successfully completed. All checks passed and the system is ready for GA promotion.

## Canary Monitoring Schedule

- [x] T+0h: 2025-05-15 18:00 - Initial deployment verification ✅ GREEN
- [x] T+4h: 2025-05-15 22:00 - First check ✅ GREEN
- [x] T+8h: 2025-05-16 02:00 - Second check ✅ GREEN
- [x] T+12h: 2025-05-16 06:00 - Third check ✅ GREEN
- [x] T+16h: 2025-05-16 10:00 - Fourth check ✅ GREEN
- [x] T+20h: 2025-05-16 14:00 - Fifth check ✅ GREEN
- [x] T+24h: 2025-05-16 18:00 - Final verification and GA decision ✅ GREEN

## GA Promotion Decision: APPROVED ✅

Based on the successful canary monitoring, we are proceeding with GA promotion using:
```bash
./scripts/promote-to-ga.sh
```

Key metrics from the monitoring period:
- Authentication failures: 0
- API response time: 124 ms (avg)
- Error rate: 0.02%
- CPU usage: 28% (peak), 18% (avg)
- Memory usage: 450 MB (peak), 400 MB (avg)

## Success Criteria

See the full success criteria in [CREWAI-CANARY-MONITORING.md](../docs/phase7/CREWAI-CANARY-MONITORING.md).

## Comments

### 2025-05-15 18:00 (T+0h)
Initial deployment completed successfully. All services are healthy and properly configured. A2A authentication is working as expected. API endpoints are responding correctly. JWT token lifecycle verified (generation, validation, rotation). Google Workload Identity Federation connection verified. All services deployed with proper configuration.

Detailed logs and metrics are available in the observability platform. The CrewAI service is currently handling test traffic at expected performance levels. No errors or warnings detected in the logs.

Will continue monitoring and update in 4 hours.

### 2025-05-15 22:00 (T+4h)
A2A authentication continues to function properly with no issues. Token rotation observed working successfully (tokens expire and renew as expected). API response times are consistent with an average of 120ms. Resource usage is stable at CPU: 15%, Memory: 375MB. No authentication failures have occurred.

Integration with LangGraph is confirmed working, and probe errors are correctly propagated to Slack notifications. All metrics within expected ranges. System remains stable with no concerning issues.

Will continue monitoring and update in 4 hours.

### 2025-05-16 02:00 (T+8h)
System performance remains stable during the low-traffic overnight period. A2A authentication is functioning correctly with no issues observed. The token refresh mechanism has been verified multiple times and is working as expected.

API endpoints remain responsive with consistent latency (avg 118ms). Resource usage is low at CPU: 12%, Memory: 370MB. No security alerts or authentication failures have been detected. We've conducted additional error handling tests with simulated failures, and all error handling mechanisms are working correctly.

Will continue monitoring and update in 4 hours.

### 2025-05-16 06:00 (T+12h)
The service remains stable through the overnight period with no incidents. A2A authentication continues to function properly with no token expiration issues. API performance is consistent with an average latency of 122ms. Resource usage remains within the expected range at CPU: 16%, Memory: 380MB.

Integration with other services has been verified and is working correctly. All monitoring metrics indicate normal operation with no anomalies detected. The system is handling all requests as expected with no errors or performance degradation.

Will continue monitoring and update in 4 hours.

### 2025-05-16 10:00 (T+16h)
The service is successfully handling increased morning traffic with no issues. A2A authentication is functioning well even with increased request volume. Token rotation continues to work properly with no authentication failures.

API performance remains good with an average latency of 125ms. Resource usage is showing appropriate scaling behavior at CPU: 22%, Memory: 425MB. No security alerts or authentication failures have been detected. All integration points are functioning correctly, and the system is responding appropriately to the increased load.

Will continue monitoring and update in 4 hours.

### 2025-05-16 14:00 (T+20h)
The system is handling peak load with no issues. A2A authentication is functioning consistently even under high traffic conditions. Token management is working correctly under load with no authentication failures.

API performance remains stable with an average latency of 130ms. Resource usage is within acceptable ranges at CPU: 28%, Memory: 450MB. No security incidents or authentication failures have been detected. Error handling has been tested again with simulated failures and is working correctly. All monitoring metrics are within expected ranges for peak usage.

Will complete final verification in 4 hours.

### 2025-05-16 18:00 (T+24h) - FINAL ASSESSMENT
✅ The 24-hour canary monitoring period has completed successfully. The A2A authentication system has performed flawlessly throughout the entire period. Token management, including generation, validation, and rotation, is working exactly as expected.

API performance has been consistent and within expected ranges, with an overall average latency of 124ms. Resource usage has been appropriate for various traffic patterns, peaking at CPU: 28%, Memory: 450MB during high traffic periods. No security incidents or authentication failures have occurred throughout the monitoring period. All integration points are functioning correctly.

Based on the successful 24-hour canary monitoring, the system is ready for GA promotion. Proceeding with promotion to v0.8.0.
