# Post-Deployment Verification Checklist for v0.7.0

This checklist outlines the verification steps to be performed after deploying v0.7.0 to production.

## Deployment Verification

- [ ] Verify that the deploy-prod workflow completed successfully
- [ ] Confirm that all services are running with the v0.7.0 tag
- [ ] Check that no deployment-related errors are present in logs
- [ ] Verify that all health checks are passing

## LangGraph Remediation System

- [ ] Verify that the LangGraph remediation system is initialized properly
- [ ] Confirm that environment variables are correctly applied
- [ ] Test remediation workflow with a non-critical service
- [ ] Verify that remediation spans appear in OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Check that timeouts and retries are working as expected

## Slack Integration

- [ ] Verify that Slack Socket Mode connection is established
- [ ] Test `/alfred health` command and verify response
- [ ] Test `/alfred remediate <service>` command on a test service
- [ ] Verify that escalation messages include proper error details
- [ ] Check that thread-based conversation works correctly

## Monitoring and Observability

- [ ] Verify that Prometheus metrics for remediation are being collected
- [ ] Check Grafana dashboards for remediation success/failure rates
- [ ] Confirm that LangGraph spans are visible in the trace explorer
- [ ] Verify that log aggregation includes remediation events
- [ ] Check that alert rules for remediation failures are active

## Performance Validation

- [ ] Measure remediation latency in production (target: <60s)
- [ ] Monitor resource usage of the remediation system
- [ ] Verify that Slack commands respond within acceptable timeouts
- [ ] Check load impact on connected systems during remediation

## Security Verification

- [ ] Verify that Slack Socket Mode is using proper authentication
- [ ] Check that webhook URLs are properly protected
- [ ] Confirm that sensitive information is not exposed in logs
- [ ] Verify that access controls are properly enforced

## Roll-Back Plan

If critical issues are found during verification, follow these steps:

1. Immediately notify the DevOps team
2. Trigger the rollback workflow with:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run rollback.yml -f tag="v0.6.0"
   ```
3. Update the Slack incident channel with status
4. Prepare an incident report with details of the issue

## Verification Success Criteria

The deployment is considered successfully verified when:

- All checklist items are passing
- No critical or high-severity issues are found
- Remediation workflows execute successfully
- Performance metrics are within expected ranges
- No security concerns are identified
