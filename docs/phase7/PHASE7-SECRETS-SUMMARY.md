# Phase 7 CI/CD Configuration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to unblock Phase 7 implementation.

## 1. GitHub Secrets Configuration

The following secrets must be added to the repository:

### Staging Environment
- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` - For Slack API authentication
- `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` - For Slack Socket Mode
- `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` - For Slack request verification

### Production Environment
- `CREWAI_ENDPOINT_PROD` - Production CrewAI service URL
- `CREWAI_A2A_CLIENT_ID` - Google A2A authentication client ID
- `CREWAI_A2A_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google A2A authentication client secret

## 2. CI/CD Pipeline Updates

The GitHub Actions workflow has been updated to:

- Add a new `slack-smoke` job that runs Slack integration tests
- Specify environment contexts for jobs to access the appropriate secrets
- Add CrewAI credentials to the production deployment job

## 3. Branch Protection

The branch protection rules should be updated to require the `orchestration-integration` status check before merging to main.

## 4. Documentation

Additional documentation has been created to support these changes:

- `docs/operations/github-secrets.md` - Guide for managing GitHub Secrets
- `docs/phase7/secrets-checklist.md` - Checklist for verifying secret configuration

## 5. Verification Steps

To verify that the CI/CD pipeline is properly configured:

1. Confirm all required secrets are added to the repository
2. Create a test PR to verify the slack-smoke job passes
3. Check that secrets are not exposed in build logs
4. Ensure the orchestration-integration job completes successfully

## Next Steps

Once these changes are merged:

1. Update branch protection rules to require the orchestration-integration check
2. Proceed with Phase 7A implementation (Slack interactive layer)
3. Continue with subsequent milestones (7B, 7C, 7D)
