# CrewAI v0.8.0-rc1 Canary Monitoring

This document tracks the 24-hour canary monitoring period for the v0.8.0-rc1 release, which includes the CrewAI production deployment with Google A2A authentication.

## Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Verify CrewAI service is deployed and healthy
- [ ] Confirm A2A token authentication is working correctly
- [ ] Test API endpoints with valid authentication
- [ ] Verify error handling for invalid authentication
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics and resource usage
- [ ] Check integration with other services
- [ ] Validate logging and observability

## Key Metrics

### Authentication Performance

- Token acquisition time: XX ms (avg)
- Authentication validation time: XX ms (avg)
- Authentication failures: X (if any)

### API Performance

- Response time: XX ms (avg)
- Throughput: XX requests/minute
- Error rate: XX%

### Resource Usage

- Memory usage: XX MB
- Network I/O: XX MB

## Success Criteria for GA Promotion

- No critical or high severity issues during the 24-hour period
- Authentication working correctly with no security concerns
- API endpoints functioning with expected performance
- Resource usage within acceptable limits
- Integration with other services verified
- Logging and observability confirmed

## Recommendation

Based on the monitoring results, the recommendation is to:
- [TBD: Promote to GA / Extend monitoring / Rollback]
