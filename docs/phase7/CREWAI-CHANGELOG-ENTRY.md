- Least privilege service account permissions
- Kubernetes secrets for secure token management

### Developer Experience

- Simplified client wrapper API for integrating with CrewAI
- Comprehensive documentation for A2A authentication flow
- Clear integration test examples
- Secure CI/CD pipeline with token management

### Infrastructure

- GCP Service Account configurations
- Workload Identity Pool and provider setup
- Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- GitHub Actions workflow integration

### Documentation

- Detailed A2A authentication flow diagrams and explanation
- CrewAI client usage examples and best practices
- CI secrets configuration guide
- Troubleshooting and error handling guidance

### Migration Guide

If you were previously using the CrewAI stub implementation, follow these steps to migrate:

1. Update imports from `workers.crewai_stub` to `alfred_agent.crewai`
2. Replace `send_task` calls with the new client implementation
3. Update environment configuration to include required CrewAI settings
4. Add proper error handling for API requests

```python
# Before
from workers.crewai_stub import send_task

result = send_task(payload)

# After
from alfred_agent.crewai import send_task

try:
    result = send_task(payload)
except Exception as e:
    # Implement error handling
```
