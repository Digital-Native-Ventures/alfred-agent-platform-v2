## Verification Details

### Escalation Message Format

Example escalation message JSON with probe_error field:

```json
{
  "channel": "C12345",
  "thread_ts": "1684170824.123456",
  "text": "❌ Failed to remediate model-router after 3/3 attempts. This issue has been escalated to the on-call team.\nLast error: Connection refused: [Errno 111] Connection refused",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*Remediation Failed*: model-router"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "❌ Failed after 3/3 attempts. Escalated to on-call team."
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "*Error Details*:\nConnection refused: [Errno 111] Connection refused"
      },
      "fields": [
        {
          "type": "mrkdwn",
          "text": "*Service*: model-router"
        },
        {
          "type": "mrkdwn",
          "text": "*Time*: 2025-05-15 21:34:12"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "probe_error": "Connection refused: [Errno 111] Connection refused",
    "service": "model-router",
    "retry_count": 3,
    "max_retries": 3
  }
}
```

### LangGraph OTEL Spans

Verified the following span attributes in OTEL explorer:

- `service.name`: "remediation"
- `remediation.service`: "<service_name>"
- `remediation.node`: "restart", "wait", "probe", "escalate", etc.
- `remediation.status`: "success" or "escalated"
- `remediation.error`: Present when probe errors occur
- `remediation.attempts`: Number of retry attempts

### Success Criteria Verification

- ✅ No increase in error rates during the 24-hour period
- ✅ All monitoring items verified and passing
- ✅ Slack integration functioning correctly with proper error details
- ✅ 31 successful remediations performed (target was at least 5)
- ✅ All escalation messages properly formatted with error details

## Recommendation

Based on the successful 24-hour canary period with no critical findings, the system is ready for GA promotion. All success criteria have been met, and the new features are functioning as expected.
