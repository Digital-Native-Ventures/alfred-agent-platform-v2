2. Update developer onboarding docs
3. Add CI checks for namespace compliance

### Future Phases
- Phase 8.1: Add comprehensive type hints
- Phase 8.2: Migrate agent services to `alfred.agents.*`
- Phase 8.3: Create namespace validation tools

## Lessons Learned

1. **Incremental Migration**: Breaking the work into rounds made it manageable
2. **CI Integration**: Early CI fixes prevented larger issues
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs essential for team adoption

## Team Impact

This refactor provides:
- 🎯 Clearer code organization
- 🔍 Better IDE support and autocomplete
- 🛡️ Foundation for type safety
- 📚 Improved developer experience

## Conclusion

Phase 7D successfully transformed the codebase from scattered services to a well-organized namespace hierarchy. The `alfred.*` namespace now provides a solid foundation for future development, type safety improvements, and better code maintainability.

*Mission Complete! 🚀*
