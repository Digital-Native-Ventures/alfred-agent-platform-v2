# Health Check Implementation Summary

## Progress Update - May 15, 2025

### Completed Work

#### Phase 1: Initial Assessment âœ…
- Documented current health check status across all services
- Built local healthcheck image (alfred/healthcheck:0.4.0)

- Documented implementation plan and standard patterns

#### Phase 2: Core Services âœ…
- Fixed model-registry Dockerfile

  - Created custom healthcheck.sh script as alternative to binary
  - Added proper dependencies for health checks
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to use custom script
- Fixed agent-atlas Dockerfile
  - Created new Dockerfile with proper healthcheck structure
  - Added proper dependencies and fallback healthcheck script
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to use direct curl for health checks
- Fixed agent-rag Dockerfile

  - Added fallback healthcheck.sh script
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to use direct curl

#### Phase 3: Agent Services âœ…
- Fixed agent-financial Dockerfile
  - Added proper permissions for healthcheck binary
  - Added netcat dependency for healthcheck script
  - Created fallback healthcheck.sh script
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to use direct curl for health checks
- Fixed agent-legal Dockerfile
  - Fixed similar issues as with agent-financial
  - Added fallback healthcheck.sh script
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to use direct curl for health checks
- Fixed agent-social Dockerfile
  - Added proper permissions and dependencies
  - Created fallback healthcheck.sh script
  - Fixed the complex CMD nested shell structure 
  - Updated docker-compose.yml to use direct curl
- Fixed llm-service configuration in docker-compose.yml
  - Added port mapping for metrics exposure (9094:9091)
  - Configured direct curl for healthcheck
  - Added prometheus.metrics.port label for discovery

### Current Status
- **Healthy Services**: 19 (55.9%)
- **Unhealthy Services**: 13 (38.2%)
- **No Health Checks**: 2 (5.9%)

### Next Steps - Phase 4: UI Services ðŸ”„

1. Fix UI service Dockerfiles:
   - mission-control-simplified (ui-admin)
   - streamlit-chat (ui-chat)
   - auth-ui

2. Rebuild and verify each service after fixing
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache <service>
   docker-compose up -d <service>
   docker ps --format "{{.Names}}:{{.Status}}" | grep <service>
   ```

3. Update implementation status document as services are fixed

4. Move to Phase 5 (Remaining Services) once all UI services are fixed

### Common Issues Found and Solutions

1. **Circular Dependencies in Dockerfiles**
   - Problem: Incorrectly ordered statements in multi-stage builds
   - Solution: Ensure FROM healthcheck stage comes before main FROM, followed by COPY statement

2. **Missing Required Dependencies**
   - Problem: Containers missing curl and netcat needed for health checks
   - Solution: Added explicit installation of dependencies in Dockerfiles

3. **Healthcheck Binary Compatibility Issues**
   - Problem: Healthcheck binary having exec format errors or permission issues
   - Solution: Created fallback shell scripts using curl for health checks

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - Problem: Conflict between application metrics and healthcheck metrics, both using 9091
   - Solution: Configure application to use a different port via environment variables

### Standardized Pattern

```dockerfile
FROM alfred/healthcheck:0.4.0 AS healthcheck

FROM <base-image>
COPY --from=healthcheck /usr/local/bin/healthcheck /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/healthcheck

# Install necessary dependencies for health checks
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    curl \
    netcat-traditional \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Fallback shell script if binary doesn't work
RUN echo '#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\ncurl -f -s http://localhost:<PORT>/health > /dev/null || exit 1\nexit 0' > /usr/local/bin/healthcheck.sh && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/healthcheck.sh

# Service-specific content...

# Expose both application and metrics ports
EXPOSE <app-port>
EXPOSE 9091

# Start with healthcheck wrapper
CMD ["healthcheck", "--export-prom", ":9091", "--", "<your-command>"]
```

In docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:<PORT>/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 20s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 45s
```
