# Grafana Dashboard Preview for Database Health Monitoring

This document provides a preview of the Database Health Dashboard implemented for the Alfred Agent Platform v2. The dashboard displays critical health and performance metrics for all database services in the platform.

## Dashboard Overview

The Database Health Dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring of all database services including PostgreSQL, Redis, and the HTTP-based database services. It visualizes key metrics such as:

1. Health status of all database services
2. Response times
3. Connection counts and usage
4. Memory utilization
5. Query performance

## Dashboard Panels

### 1. Database Services Health Status

![Database Health Status](https://via.placeholder.com/800x200?text=Database+Services+Health+Status)

This panel shows the current health status of all database services. Each service is represented by a stat panel that shows:
- GREEN: Service is healthy
- RED: Service is down or experiencing issues

The panel makes it immediately clear which database services are operational and which ones might need attention.

### 2. Service Response Time

![Service Response Time](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Service+Response+Time)

This time series chart displays response times for health checks across all database services. It helps identify:
- Slow-responding services
- Performance trends over time
- Potential issues before they cause outages

### 3. PostgreSQL Metrics

![PostgreSQL Connections](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=PostgreSQL+Connections)

This panel shows:
- Current active connections
- Maximum connection limit
- Connection utilization percentage

This is critical for identifying potential connection pool exhaustion before it impacts application performance.

### 4. Redis Metrics

![Redis Memory Usage](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Redis+Memory+Usage)

This panel displays:
- Memory usage in bytes
- Connected clients count
- Key counts across databases

These metrics help monitor Redis performance and identify potential memory-related issues.

### 5. Query Performance

![Query Performance](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Query+Performance)

This panel shows:
- 95th percentile query response time
- 50th percentile (median) query response time
- Query response time distribution

This helps identify slow queries that might be impacting overall database performance.

### 6. HTTP API Response Time

![HTTP API Response Time](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=HTTP+API+Response+Time)

This panel displays response times for HTTP-based database services (db-api, db-auth, db-admin, db-storage) to help identify API performance issues.

## Implementation Details

The dashboard is implemented using:

1. **Time-series panels** for tracking metrics over time
2. **Stat panels** for current health status visualization
3. **Threshold-based coloring** for immediate visual feedback
4. **Percentile-based metrics** for query performance analysis

## Alert Rules

The dashboard is configured with the following alerting rules:

1. **ServiceDown**: Triggers when any database service has a health status of 0 for more than 1 minute
   - Severity: Critical
   - Notification: Slack and Email

2. **HighConnectionUtilization**: Triggers when PostgreSQL connection utilization exceeds 80% for more than 5 minutes
   - Severity: Warning
   - Notification: Slack

3. **SlowQueryResponse**: Triggers when 95th percentile query response time exceeds 1 second for more than 5 minutes
   - Severity: Warning
   - Notification: Slack

## How to Access

1. Access the Grafana instance at http://localhost:3005
2. Log in with admin credentials
3. Navigate to Dashboards > Database Health Dashboard
4. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds

## Next Steps

1. **Custom Metrics**: Add additional database-specific metrics based on observed usage patterns
2. **Service Dependencies**: Add visualization of service dependency relationships
3. **Historical Analysis**: Add panels for historical trend analysis
4. **User Authentication Metrics**: Add metrics for auth-related database operations
5. **Integration with Incident Management**: Integrate alerts with on-call rotation system
