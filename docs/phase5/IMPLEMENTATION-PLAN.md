# Phase 5: Database and Infrastructure Health Checks

This document outlines the implementation plan for Phase 5 of our health check standardization project, focusing on database and infrastructure services.

## Overview

Phase 5 completes our health check standardization by addressing the remaining database and infrastructure services. This phase is critical for ensuring comprehensive monitoring across all components of the Alfred Agent Platform.

## Services to Implement

| Service | Type | Priority | Status |
|---------|------|----------|--------|
| db-api | Database | 1 | Not Started |
| db-admin | Database | 1 | Not Started |
| db-realtime | Database | 1 | Not Started |
| vector-db | Database | 2 | Not Started |
| mail-server | Infrastructure | 2 | Not Started |
| monitoring-db | Monitoring | 3 | Not Started |
| monitoring-node | Monitoring | 3 | Not Started |
| monitoring-redis | Monitoring | 3 | Not Started |
| redis-exporter | Monitoring | 3 | Not Started |

## Implementation Steps

1. Database Probe Development
   - Implement common database driver interface
   - Create PostgreSQL driver implementation
   - Add basic tests for database health checks
   - Integrate with healthcheck binary

2. Service Updates
   - Update Dockerfiles to use alfred/healthcheck:0.4.0
   - Configure health check endpoints
   - Expose metrics on port 9091
   - Update docker-compose configurations

3. Prometheus Integration
   - Update Prometheus configuration to scrape new services
   - Create alerting rules for database health
   - Test metrics collection

4. Documentation
   - Update service documentation
   - Create example configurations
   - Document metrics and alerting rules

## Timeline

Week 1:
- Complete database probe development
- Update db-api, db-admin, and db-realtime services
- Create basic tests

Week 2:
- Implement remaining services
- Update Prometheus configuration
- Create alerting rules

Week 3:
- Complete documentation
- Perform end-to-end testing
- Create PR for review

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit Tests:
   - Use sqlmock to test database drivers
   - Verify metrics collection
   - Test connection error handling

2. Integration Tests:
   - Use docker-compose to test with real databases
   - Verify metrics are correctly exposed
   - Test Prometheus scraping

3. End-to-End Tests:
   - Deploy all services with health checks
   - Verify Grafana dashboards
   - Test alerting rules

## Success Criteria

- All services expose health checks on standard endpoints
- Metrics are available on port 9091
- Prometheus successfully scrapes all services
- Grafana dashboards show database health metrics
- Alert rules correctly identify health issues
