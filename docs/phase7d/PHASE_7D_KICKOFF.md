# Phase 7D: MyPy and Namespace Hygiene

## Overview
Phase 7D focuses on improving code quality through enhanced static type checking with MyPy and standardizing namespace organization across the project.

> **NOTE:** This phase begins after the rollback of v0.8.1-rc1 due to health check failures in db-metrics services. See [DB-METRICS-ROLLBACK-REPORT.md](../phase7/rollback/DB-METRICS-ROLLBACK-REPORT.md) for details.

## Goals
1. Increase MyPy coverage across the codebase
2. Fix existing type-related issues
3. Standardize Python module namespaces
4. Improve developer experience through better static typing

## Key Tasks
- [ ] Implement MyPy in CI pipeline with strict configuration
- [ ] Fix existing type annotations in core modules
- [ ] Add type annotations to previously untyped code
- [ ] Standardize import patterns and namespace usage
- [ ] Create comprehensive typing documentation

## Timeline
- Week 1: Analyze current MyPy coverage and namespace usage
- Week 2: Fix type annotations in core modules
- Week 3: Address peripheral modules and standardize namespaces
- Week 4: Complete documentation and finalize CI integration

## Benefits
- Earlier detection of type-related bugs
- Improved code maintainability
- Better IDE support and developer experience
- More consistent codebase organization
- Simplified onboarding for new team members

## Implementation Approach
- Start with critical services and core libraries
- Prioritize files with the most dependencies
- Address files with the most type errors first
- Create reusable type definitions for common patterns
- Establish namespace standards in documentation
