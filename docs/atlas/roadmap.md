| ASCII or Mermaid sequence diagram of request flow | Gives visual learners a 5-second grasp of message paths | Medium | Planned |
| One-liner Docker / k8s deploy snippet | Lets readers jump straight from docs to running code | Medium | Planned |
| Metrics cheat-sheet (e.g., atlas_tokens_total, run_seconds_p95, alert thresholds) | Helps ops teams know what "good" looks like | Low | Planned |
| Link to docs/atlas/usage.md for prompt-craft tips | Surfaces deeper docs without cluttering the summary | Low | Planned |
| Version & commit hash badge in the header | Signals freshness and makes CI status visible at a glance | Low | Planned |

| Hybrid reranker for RAG | Improves relevance of retrieved context | High | Planned |
| Streaming responses | Better user experience for large generations | Medium | Planned |
| Multi-provider LLM support | Reduced dependency on OpenAI | Medium | Planned |
| Fine-tuned domain-specific models | Improved accuracy for architecture tasks | Low | Planned |
| Automated testing suite | Ensures reliability across changes | High | Planned |

## Operations Improvements

| Enhancement | Benefit | Priority | Status |
