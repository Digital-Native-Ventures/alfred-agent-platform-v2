# Spring Clean Inventory

This PR is part of the spring clean inventory task. It resolves mypy.ini formatting issues and handles duplicate module conflicts.

## Changes

- Fixed mypy.ini syntax by changing `[[mypy.overrides]]` to `[mypy.overrides]`
- Updated exclude paths to properly exclude modules that cause conflicts
- Added py.typed file to mark the Alfred bot app directory as a typed package
- Resolved merge conflicts in test_chains.py using the better typed implementation

## Remaining Tasks

- Address pre-existing mypy errors in separate PRs
- Fix Docker image access denied errors in the CI system
