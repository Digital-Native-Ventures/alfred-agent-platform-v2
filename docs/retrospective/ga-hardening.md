# GA-Hardening Phase Retrospective

> Linked issue: #581
> Status: Draft
> Period: 27 May - 06 Jun 2025

## 1 Overview
The GA-Hardening phase aimed to strengthen platform reliability through 7 critical work-streams. This phase successfully delivered 5 complete work-streams with 2 pending final review/completion.

### Goals vs Outcomes
- **Goal**: Complete all 7 work-streams by 06 Jun
- **Actual**: 5/7 complete, 2 in final stages (runbooks awaiting merge, retrospective in progress)

## 2 Metrics
| Metric | Target | Actual | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|
| Bench p95 latency | â‰¤ 75 s | âœ… Met (workflow fixed) | bench.yml (#584, #585) |
| Cold-start containers | â‰¤ 34 | âœ… 34 containers | docker-compose.yml |
| Alert noise reduction | < 5/day | _TBD_ | Sentry metrics pending |
| E2E test coverage | 100% core paths | âœ… Achieved | PR #566 |
| Healthcheck compliance | 100% services | âœ… 100% | All services use binary |
| Runbook completion | 4 critical | ðŸ”„ 4/4 written, pending merge | PRs #577-580 |

## 3 What Went Well
- **Rapid iteration**: Completed 5 work-streams in under 2 days
- **E2E testing framework**: Comprehensive smoke & regression suite with `/alfred health` CLI (#566)
- **Healthcheck standardization**: All services now use consistent health binary
- **Credential reconciliation**: Automated secret rotation procedures documented
- **Benchmark workflow**: Fixed and operational after troubleshooting (#584, #585)
- **Import guard tests**: Prevented future dependency breakage (#569)

## 4 What Didn't
- **Benchmark artifact uploads**: Still failing due to GitHub Actions issue (non-critical)
- **Runbook review velocity**: All 4 PRs still awaiting maintainer reviews
- **Pre-commit hook conflicts**: Multiple instances of stash conflicts during rapid development
- **Observability gaps**: Sentry metrics integration not yet validated

## 5 Action Items
| Owner | Item | Due | Issue |
|-------|------|-----|-------|
| Maintainers | Review & merge runbook PRs (#577-580) | 03 Jun | #571 |
| Claude Code | Complete retrospective metrics from Sentry | 06 Jun | #581 |
| o3 | Freeze checklist automation | 10 Jul | TBD |
| Platform team | Fix benchmark artifact retention | 07 Jun | TBD |
| DevOps | Validate Sentry alert reduction | 10 Jun | TBD |

## 6 Lessons Learned
1. **Work-stream parallelization**: Running multiple work-streams concurrently accelerated delivery
2. **Draft PR workflow**: Effective for runbook collaboration but needs faster review SLA
3. **Exit criteria importance**: Clear benchmarks (â‰¤75s) drove focused improvements
4. **Automation value**: Scripts like `ga-hardening-retrospective.sh` reduced manual tracking

## 7 Recommendations
- Establish review SLAs for critical path PRs
- Automate runbook generation from templates
- Add Sentry metrics to standard dashboards
- Create reusable E2E test patterns for other services

## 8 Work-stream Summary

### âœ… Complete (5/7)
1. **Credential Reconciliation** - PR #560 merged
2. **Healthcheck Standardisation** - PR #562 merged
3. **Observability Baseline** - PR #563 merged
4. **E2E Smoke & Regression Suite** - PR #566 merged
5. **Broken Dependency Cleanup** - PR #569 merged

### ðŸ”„ In Progress (2/7)
6. **Documentation & Runbooks** - PRs #577-580 awaiting review
7. **Phase Retrospective & Sign-off** - This document (PR #586)

## 9 Key Deliverables
- `/alfred health` CLI command for platform-wide health checks
- 4 operational runbooks for critical procedures
- Standardized healthcheck binary across all services
- E2E test framework with smoke, regression, and Slack integration tests
- Fixed benchmark workflow meeting â‰¤75s SLA
