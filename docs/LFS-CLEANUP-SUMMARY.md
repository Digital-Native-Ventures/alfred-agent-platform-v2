# Git LFS Cleanup Summary

## Actions Taken

### 1. Inspected LFS Usage
- Identified 8 files tracked in Git LFS
- Largest file: `gh.tar.gz` (11 MB) - GitHub CLI archive
- Total LFS storage: ~12 MB across all files

### 2. Pruned Untracked LFS Files
- Ran `git lfs prune`
- Freed up 71 MB of untracked objects
- 2 objects removed, 27 retained

### 3. Removed Unnecessary Files
- Removed `gh.tar.gz` from LFS tracking
- File was redundant as gh CLI already extracted to `gh_2.40.1_linux_amd64/`
- Saved 11 MB of LFS storage

### 4. Updated .gitattributes
- Added proper LFS tracking rules for binary files:
  - `*.tar.gz`, `*.tgz`, `*.zip` → LFS
  - `*.jpg`, `*.png`, `*.jpeg` → LFS
- Excluded text files from LFS:
  - `*.md`, `*.txt`, `*.py`, `*.js`, etc. → NOT LFS

### 5. Cleanup Results
- **Total Storage Freed**: 82 MB
  - 71 MB from pruning
  - 11 MB from removing gh.tar.gz
- **Files remaining in LFS**: 7 small files (~1 MB total)

### 6. Created PR #501
- Branch: `fix/lfs-budget-cleanup`
- Includes all cleanup changes
- Should resolve LFS budget issues blocking CI

## Next Steps

1. Monitor PR #501 CI status
2. Once merged, affected PRs should be able to run CI without LFS budget errors
3. Consider external storage for any future large archives

## Files Not in LFS (but large)
Found but already in .gitignore:
- `./models/models/blobs/*` (3.6GB + 609MB) - ML model files
- `./bin/act` (20MB) - GitHub Actions runner
