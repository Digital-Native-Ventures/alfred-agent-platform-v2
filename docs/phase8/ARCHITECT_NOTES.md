# Phase 8 – Architect Notes

This file is maintained by GPT-o3 (Architect role) and captures milestone-level reasoning, design choices, GPT-o3 directives, and retrospective guidance.
All Claude Code contributors must review this before contributing to the milestone.

## 🧭 Phase Context
- Namespace hygiene complete (Phase 7D)
- Type safety and alert enhancement work ongoing under Phase 8.1
- Mypy strict is CI-gated for all `alfred/` modules

## 🧠 GPT-o3 Guidance
- Use `alfred.*` namespace for all new code
- CI must pass mypy + tests before PR is opened
- All Claude instructions must come from GPT-o3 in structured format
- Claude must not assume task ownership without GPT-o3 delegation

## 📝 Retrospective Notes (to be filled at phase close)
- [ ] What design principles did we reinforce?
- [ ] What breakdowns happened (if any)?
- [ ] Suggested rules for Phase 8.2+?
