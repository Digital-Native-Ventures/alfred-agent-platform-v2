# Sprint 4 Kickoff - ML Enhancements & SLO

## Sprint 4 Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. Implement automated ML model retraining pipeline
2. Add dynamic threshold optimization
3. Integrate HuggingFace transformers for better embeddings
4. Create SLO dashboard in Grafana 11

### Target Metrics
- Noise reduction: ≥ 45% (from 42%)
- P95 inference latency: ≤ 140ms
- Test coverage: ≥ 92%
- False negative rate: < 1.5%

## Key Features

### 1. ML Retrain Pipeline
- Ray-based distributed training
- Weekly automated retraining
- A/B testing capability
- MLflow model versioning

### 2. Dynamic Thresholds
- Per-service threshold optimization
- UI for manual adjustment
- Historical trend analysis
- Auto-optimization algorithms

### 3. HuggingFace Integration
- Sentence transformers for embeddings
- HNSW vector search with FAISS
- Performance benchmarking
- Model comparison framework

### 4. SLO Dashboard
- Grafana 11 dashboards
- Noise reduction trends
- Model performance metrics
- Training pipeline status
- SLO burn rate alerts

## Sprint Schedule
- Start: May 18, 2025
- End: June 1, 2025 (2 weeks)
- Daily standups: 10:00 UTC
- Demo: June 1, 2025

## Team Assignments
- ML Pipeline: Team lead
- Thresholds: Engineering team
- HuggingFace: Senior ML engineer
- SLO Dashboard: SRE team

## Definition of Done
- All tests passing (≥ 92% coverage)
- Documentation complete
- Performance benchmarks met
- Production rollout plan approved
- SLO dashboard live

## Dependencies
- Ray 2.10.0
- HuggingFace Transformers 4.37.0
- FAISS 1.7.4
- Grafana 11.0.0
- MLflow 2.11.0

## Risks & Mitigations
1. **Risk**: Model training time exceeds 5 minutes
   - **Mitigation**: Implement GPU acceleration

2. **Risk**: False negative rate increases
   - **Mitigation**: Implement gradual rollout with monitoring

3. **Risk**: Memory usage exceeds limits
   - **Mitigation**: Optimize batch sizes, use gradient accumulation

## Success Criteria
- Achieve ≥ 45% noise reduction
- Maintain P95 latency ≤ 140ms
- Zero production incidents during rollout
- Positive user feedback on thresholds UI
