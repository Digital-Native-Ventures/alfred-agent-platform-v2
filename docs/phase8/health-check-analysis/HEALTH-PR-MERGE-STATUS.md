# Health PR Merge & Validation Status
*Generated: 25 May 2025*

## Summary
Unable to merge the critical health-check PRs due to CI failures, but applied local fixes that improved some services.

## PR Status

### PR #466 - Add healthcheck prefix validation to CI
- **Status**: Open, auto-merge enabled
- **CI**: All checks passing
- **Issue**: Not mergeable - head branch not up to date with base

### PR #465 - Align healthcheck base-image prefix
- **Status**: Open
- **CI**: Multiple failures (Performance Regression, db-metrics-smoke, integration tests)
- **Issue**: Cannot merge due to failing checks

### PR #432 - Fix pubsub-metrics Dockerfile & health-check
- **Status**: Open
- **CI**: Multiple failures (black formatting, isort, check-parity)
- **Issue**: Cannot merge due to failing checks

## Local Fixes Applied

1. **Fixed slack-adapter**:
   - Created requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
   - Modified Dockerfile to use pip instead of poetry
   - Result: ✅ Healthy

2. **Fixed db-auth**:
   - Created auth_db database
   - Created auth schema
   - Result: ✅ Healthy

3. **Created health check overrides**:
   - docker-compose.override.targeted-health-fixes.yml
   - Fixed port configurations for metrics services (9091 → 9103)

## Current Health Status

### Overall Metrics
- **Total Services**: 39 (reduced from 59 due to some containers not running)
- **Healthy Services**: 13 (33%)
- **Unhealthy Services**: 26 (67%)

### Healthy Services
1. agent-bizdev
2. agent-core
3. auth-ui
4. crm-sync
5. db-auth
6. db-postgres
7. monitoring-dashboard
8. monitoring-metrics
9. pubsub-emulator
10. pubsub-metrics
11. redis
12. slack-adapter
13. telegram-adapter

### Key Unhealthy Services
- All db-*-metrics services (port mismatch in health checks)
- agent-atlas, agent-social
- db-admin, db-api, db-realtime, db-storage
- model-router, model-registry
- monitoring services (db, node, redis)

## Issues Encountered

1. **Build Failures**: agent-core has an empty Dockerfile issue
2. **Port Mismatches**: Health checks using wrong ports (9091 vs 9103 vs 8000)
3. **CI Failures**: PRs cannot be merged due to various CI check failures

## Recommendations

1. **Fix CI Issues First**:
   - PR #432 needs black formatting fixes
   - PR #465 needs performance and integration test fixes

2. **Local Development**:
   - Continue using override files for health checks
   - Fix port configurations in service Dockerfiles

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Fix the CI failures in the PRs
   - Or cherry-pick the specific changes needed
   - Create new PRs with clean implementations

## Validation Command Results
```bash
docker ps --format "{{.Names}}" --filter "health=unhealthy" | wc -l
# Result: 26 unhealthy services

# Health percentage: 33% (13/39)
```

**Target not met**: Goal was ≥75% healthy, achieved only 33%
