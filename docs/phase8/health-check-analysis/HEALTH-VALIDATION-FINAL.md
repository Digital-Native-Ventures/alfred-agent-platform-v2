# Health Validation Final Report
*Generated: 25 May 2025*

## Summary
Successfully merged PR #466 (healthcheck prefix validation) but unable to significantly improve service health percentage. Target of ≥75% healthy services not achieved.

## PR Merge Status

### ✅ PR #466 - Add healthcheck prefix validation to CI
- **Status**: MERGED
- Successfully rebased and merged
- Adds CI validation for consistent healthcheck base image references

### ❌ PR #465 - Align healthcheck base-image prefix
- **Status**: Skipped
- Multiple merge conflicts with main
- Changes already appear to be upstream

### ❌ PR #432 - Fix pubsub-metrics Dockerfile & health-check
- **Status**: Skipped
- Changes already upstream during rebase
- pubsub-metrics is already healthy

## Current Health Status

### Metrics
- **Total Services**: 39
- **Healthy Services**: 13 (33%)
- **Unhealthy Services**: 23 (59%)
- **Starting/Other**: 3 (8%)

### Healthy Services (13)
1. agent-bizdev
2. agent-core
3. auth-ui
4. crm-sync
5. db-auth
6. db-postgres
7. monitoring-dashboard
8. monitoring-metrics
9. pubsub-emulator
10. pubsub-metrics
11. redis
12. slack-adapter
13. telegram-adapter

### Persistently Unhealthy Services (23)
- **Database Metrics**: All db-*-metrics services (wrong port in health checks)
- **Agents**: agent-atlas, agent-social
- **Database Services**: db-admin, db-api, db-realtime, db-storage
- **Models**: model-router, model-registry
- **Monitoring**: monitoring-db, monitoring-node, monitoring-redis, redis-exporter
- **Others**: llm-service, mail-server, ui-admin, vector-db, hubspot-mock

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Port Mismatches**: Health checks using wrong ports (9091 vs 9103 vs 8000)
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Some services missing required packages
3. **Build Context Issues**: Some Dockerfiles have incorrect COPY paths
4. **Health Check Timing**: Some services need longer start_period

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Successfully merged PR #466 for CI validation
2. ✅ Created comprehensive health check override files
3. ✅ Fixed slack-adapter (added requirements.txt)
4. ✅ Fixed db-auth (created database and schema)
5. ✅ Applied targeted health fixes for metrics services

## Recommendations

1. **Create New PR**: Consolidate all health fixes into a single clean PR
2. **Fix Port Configurations**: Standardize health check ports across services
3. **Update Dockerfiles**: Fix COPY paths and ensure all dependencies are included
4. **Extend Start Periods**: Some services need 60-120s start_period

## Validation Results
```bash
# Health percentage: 33% (13/39 services)
# Target was ≥75% - NOT ACHIEVED

docker ps --filter "health=unhealthy" --format "{{.Names}}" | wc -l
# Result: 23 unhealthy services
```

## Next Steps
The health improvements require more comprehensive fixes than what the existing PRs provided. A new approach with proper port configurations and dependency fixes is needed.
