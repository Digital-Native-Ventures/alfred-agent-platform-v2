# Cold Start Test Results

## Date: May 25, 2025

### Overview
This document summarizes the results of the cold start test performed after fixing port conflicts in the docker-compose.yml file.

### Changes Made
1. **Port Conflict Resolution (PR #485 - Merged)**
   - `slack_mcp_gateway`: Changed from port 3000 to 3010
   - `slack-adapter`: Changed from port 3001 to 3011
   - `hubspot-mock`: Changed from port 8000 to 8088

### Cold Start Test Process

#### 1. Clean Environment
```bash
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
git pull origin main
```

#### 2. Build and Start Services
- Some services require building from source
- Pre-built images were pulled successfully for core infrastructure

#### 3. Current Status

##### ✅ Healthy Services
- `redis` - Running on port 6379
- `db-postgres` - Running on port 5432
- `monitoring-metrics` (Prometheus) - Running on port 9090
- `monitoring-dashboard` (Grafana) - Running on port 3005
- `pubsub-emulator` - Running on port 8085
- `mail-server` - Running on ports 1025, 8025

##### ⏳ Services Still Starting
- `monitoring-redis` - Metrics exporter starting
- `monitoring-db` - Database metrics starting
- `vector-db` - Vector database initializing
- `monitoring-node` - Node exporter starting
- `llm-service` - Ollama service starting (expected to take longer)

##### ❌ Services Requiring Build Fixes
- `agent-core` - Build context path issues
- `agent-rag` - Build context path issues
- Several other services with missing build artifacts

### Verification Results

#### Port Accessibility
- ✅ PostgreSQL: Accessible on port 5432
- ✅ Redis: Accessible on port 6379
- ✅ Prometheus: Health endpoint responding on port 9090
- ✅ Grafana: API health check passing on port 3005

#### Development Environment
- ✅ Linting: `make lint` passes successfully
- ⚠️  Tests: Failing due to missing configuration (Slack tokens, etc.)
- ✅ No port conflicts detected
- ✅ Core infrastructure services are operational

### Issues Identified

1. **Build Context Problems**
   - Several Dockerfiles reference files outside their build context
   - Need to standardize build contexts and file paths

2. **Missing Stub Files**
   - `auth-ui` missing `dist` directory
   - `agent-core` missing application files
   - Created minimal stubs to proceed with testing

3. **Configuration Requirements**
   - Tests require valid Slack tokens
   - Some services need environment-specific configuration

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Update Dockerfiles to use correct build contexts
   - Create proper stub implementations for development services
   - Document required environment variables

2. **Long-term Improvements**
   - Implement automated health check monitoring
   - Create development-specific docker-compose overrides
   - Standardize service build processes
   - Add pre-build validation scripts

### Conclusion

The port conflict resolution was successful, and the core infrastructure services are running correctly. While some application services have build issues, the development environment is functional for core platform work. The cold start test confirms that the recent changes have improved the local development experience.

### Next Steps

1. Fix remaining Dockerfile build context issues
2. Create comprehensive development setup documentation
3. Implement automated health check validation
4. Add CI/CD tests for docker-compose validity
