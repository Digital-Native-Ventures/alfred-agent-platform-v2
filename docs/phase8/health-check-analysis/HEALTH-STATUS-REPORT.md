# Health Status Report
*Generated: 25 May 2025*

## Summary
Successfully improved service health from 11 healthy services to 35 healthy services through targeted fixes.

## Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Port Conflict Resolution (PR #485 - Merged)
- slack_mcp_gateway: 3000 → 3010 (conflict with db-api)
- slack-adapter: 3001 → 3011 (conflict with db-admin)
- hubspot-mock: 8000 → 8088 (conflict with agent-atlas)

### 2. Critical Service Fixes
- **slack-adapter**: Fixed missing uvicorn dependency by creating requirements.txt
- **db-auth**: Created missing auth_db database and auth schema

### 3. Health Check Improvements
Created `docker-compose.override.targeted-health-fixes.yml` with proper health checks for:
- Agent services (agent-atlas, agent-social)
- UI services (auth-ui, ui-admin)
- Database services (db-admin, db-api, db-realtime, db-storage)
- Metrics exporters (various db-*-metrics services)
- Model services (model-registry, model-router)
- Monitoring services (monitoring-db, monitoring-redis, monitoring-node)

## Current Status

### Healthy Services (35)
- Core infrastructure: db-postgres, redis, pubsub-emulator
- Authentication: db-auth, auth-ui
- Adapters: slack-adapter, telegram-adapter
- Core services: agent-core, agent-bizdev
- Monitoring: monitoring-metrics, monitoring-dashboard
- CRM: crm-sync
- And 22 more...

### Unhealthy/Starting Services (23)
- Various services still initializing with extended start_period
- Some services may need additional configuration or dependencies

## Next Steps
1. Monitor services that are still starting (may become healthy after initialization)
2. Investigate specific errors for persistently unhealthy services
3. Consider creating service-specific initialization scripts for complex services
4. Document any required manual setup steps discovered

## Files Created/Modified
- `/alfred/adapters/slack/requirements.txt` - Created
- `/alfred/adapters/slack/Dockerfile` - Modified to use pip instead of poetry
- `docker-compose.override.targeted-health-fixes.yml` - Created with comprehensive health checks

## Verification Command
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}" | grep -c healthy
```

Current result: 35 healthy services
