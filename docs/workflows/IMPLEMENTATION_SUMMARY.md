# YouTube Workflows Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the YouTube Niche-Scout workflow functionality in the Agent Platform.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated YouTube Service API

Modified the `runNicheScout` function in `services/agent-orchestrator/src/lib/youtube-service.ts` to accept a complete configuration object:

```typescript
export async function runNicheScout(config: {
  category: string;
  subcategory: string;
  budget?: number;
  dataSources?: Record<string, any>;
}): Promise<NicheScoutResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

This allows passing all needed parameters from the wizard to the backend API.

### 2. Integrated NicheScoutWizard in WorkflowCard

Updated the `WorkflowCard` component to:
- Import necessary dependencies for NicheScoutWizard
- Add state for wizard open/close and loading states
- Implement `handleNicheScoutComplete` to process wizard output
- Conditionally render a different UI when the workflow is "Niche-Scout"

The integration enables users to:
- Click "Configure Analysis" to open the wizard
- Go through the 3-step configuration process
- Submit the configuration to the backend
- See success/error notifications

## Testing Instructions

To test the implementation:

1. Start the agent-orchestrator service:
   ```
   cd services/agent-orchestrator
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Workflows page

3. Find the "Niche-Scout" workflow card and click "Configure Analysis"

4. Complete the wizard steps:
   - Step 1: Select a main category
   - Step 2: Select a subcategory
   - Step 3: Configure budget and data sources

5. Submit the form and verify that:
   - Loading state is shown during API call
   - Success notification appears on completion
   - Trending niches appear in the results

6. For testing without backend, set `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=true` in .env

## Notes

- The implementation uses mock data as a fallback if the API fails
- The UI is responsive and handles loading/error states
- The wizard component is reusable for other similar workflows
