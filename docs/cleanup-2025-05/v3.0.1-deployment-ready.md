2. **crm-sync**: Fixed circular import via PR #589
3. **contact-ingest**: Health endpoint already fixed from previous work

### Testing Completed
- All services start without import errors
- Health checks pass on all services
- Inter-service communication verified
- No Python import errors in logs

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Staging** (Priority #1)
   ```bash
   # Use the deployment script provided earlier
   ./deploy-staging-v3.0.1.sh
   ```

2. **Monitor Staging** (1-2 hours)
   - Check service health
   - Monitor logs for errors
   - Verify inter-service communication

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - After staging validation
   - Use same deployment process

4. **Build Additional Services** (Priority #2)
   - After deployment is stable
   - model-registry, model-router, etc.

## Command Reference

```bash
docker compose up -d agent-core agent-bizdev contact-ingest crm-sync slack-adapter db-metrics alfred-bot
