# DB-Storage GA Test Report

## Test Setup
- Modified `docker-compose.override.yml` to set a secure random password for db-storage
- Password: `uCqePburMbIk5icJujMpZV02rhR8gDT6` (generated with openssl)
- Project name: `alfred-ga-v3`

## Test Results

### ✅ Service Deployment
```
NAME         IMAGE                  STATUS                             PORTS
db-storage   postgres:15.5-alpine   Up About a minute (health: starting)   0.0.0.0:5000-5001->5000-5001/tcp
```

### ✅ PostgreSQL Running
Database logs show successful startup:
```
2025-05-29 06:19:38.533 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

### ⚠️ Health Check Issue
The health check remains in "starting" state due to a configuration mismatch:
- `db-storage` health check expects endpoint at port 9091
- `db-storage-metrics` service runs on port 9103 internally
- Port mapping: 9124->9091/tcp (external)

## Summary
1. **PostgreSQL database**: Running successfully with secure password
2. **Service status**: Container is up and database is accepting connections
3. **Health check**: Configuration issue prevents health status from becoming "healthy"

## Recommendation
The db-storage service itself is working correctly. The health check configuration needs to be fixed to either:
- Point to the PostgreSQL port directly (5432) with a pg_isready command
- Or fix the metrics service port configuration
