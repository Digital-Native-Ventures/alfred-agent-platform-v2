## Issues Found

1. **crm-sync**: Has circular import error (fix in PR #589)
2. **Missing services**: Several important services were not included in the docker-release.yml workflow
3. **Service naming**: Some services have mismatched names (e.g., agent-bizdev vs agent-bizops)

## Current State

- **Total GA v3.0.0 services running**: 5
- **Healthy**: 1 (slack-adapter)
- **Starting**: 1 (agent-core)
- **Failing**: 3 (agent-bizdev, contact-ingest, crm-sync)

## Recommendation

1. Merge PR #589 to fix crm-sync import issue
2. Add missing services to docker-release.yml
3. Build and push v3.0.1 patch release with all fixes
4. Update service names for consistency
