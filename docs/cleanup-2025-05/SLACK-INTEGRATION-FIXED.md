# Slack Integration Fixed ✅

## What Was The Issue
The `/alfred` command was failing with "dispatch_failed" because:
1. Environment variables were loaded but the slack_mcp_gateway service wasn't running
2. The echo_agent (which processes commands) wasn't running

## What's Running Now

### 1. slack-adapter (v3.0.1)
- Port: 3011
- Status: ✅ Running
- Has all Slack env vars loaded

### 2. slack_mcp_gateway
- Port: 3010  
- Status: ✅ Running
- Connected to Slack via Socket Mode
- Listening for commands on Redis streams

### 3. echo-agent
- Status: ✅ Running in container
- Connected to Redis
- Processing commands from mcp.requests stream

## How Commands Flow

1. User types `/alfred ping hello` in Slack
2. Slack sends command to slack_mcp_gateway (via Socket Mode)
3. slack_mcp_gateway publishes to Redis stream `mcp.requests`
4. echo-agent reads from stream, processes command
5. echo-agent publishes response to `mcp.responses` stream
6. slack_mcp_gateway reads response and sends back to Slack

## Test The Integration

In Slack, type:
```
/alfred ping hello world
```

Expected response:
```
Echo: hello world
```

## Monitoring

View logs to debug any issues:
```bash
# Gateway logs (shows Slack connections)
docker logs slack_mcp_gateway -f

# Echo agent logs (shows command processing)
docker logs echo-agent -f

# Check Redis streams
docker exec redis redis-cli XLEN mcp.requests
docker exec redis redis-cli XLEN mcp.responses
```

## Permanent Fix

The `start-slack-integration.sh` script now:
1. Validates environment
2. Starts all required services
3. Ensures proper network connectivity
4. Provides health checks

To restart everything:
```bash
./start-slack-integration.sh
```

## Environment Management

All services now automatically get environment variables via:
- `.env` file (local secrets)
- `docker-compose.override.env.yml` (ensures all services get vars)
- Validation script checks all required vars

No more manual environment troubleshooting!
