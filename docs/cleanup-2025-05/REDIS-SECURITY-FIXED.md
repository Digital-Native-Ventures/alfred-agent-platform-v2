# Redis Security Configuration - FIXED âœ…

## What Was Wrong
1. Redis was running WITHOUT authentication despite having REDIS_PASSWORD in .env
2. This was a CRITICAL security vulnerability, especially after the recent breach
3. I initially suggested removing the password (WRONG approach)

## What's Fixed Now

### 1. Redis Configuration
Created `/config/redis.conf` with:
- `requirepass` directive to enforce authentication
- Disabled dangerous commands (FLUSHDB, FLUSHALL, KEYS, CONFIG)
- Enabled protected mode
- Proper persistence settings

### 2. Docker Compose Updates
Updated `docker-compose.yml` to:
- Mount Redis config and entrypoint script
- Pass REDIS_PASSWORD environment variable
- Update healthcheck to use authentication
- Use custom entrypoint that substitutes the password

### 3. All Services Use Authentication
- echo-agent: Uses REDIS_PASSWORD from .env
- slack_mcp_gateway: Uses REDIS_PASSWORD from .env
- All other Redis clients: Must use authentication

## Verification

Test Redis requires authentication:
```bash
# This should fail
docker exec redis redis-cli PING
# Output: NOAUTH Authentication required.

# This should work
docker exec redis redis-cli -a "$REDIS_PASSWORD" PING
# Output: PONG
```

## Security Best Practices Applied

1. **Authentication Required**: No operations without password
2. **Dangerous Commands Disabled**: Can't flush database or access config
3. **Environment Variables**: Password stored in .env, not in code
4. **Healthchecks Updated**: Use authentication for monitoring
5. **Protected Mode**: Enabled to prevent external access

## Important Notes

- NEVER run Redis without authentication
- Always validate security configurations after deployment
- Monitor Redis logs for unauthorized access attempts
- Rotate passwords regularly
- Use strong, randomly generated passwords

## Next Steps

1. Consider Redis ACLs for more granular permissions
2. Enable TLS for Redis connections
3. Set up Redis Sentinel for HA with auth
4. Regular security audits
