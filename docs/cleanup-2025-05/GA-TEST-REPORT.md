# GA Release v3.0.0 Test Report

## Test Setup
- Modified `docker-compose.override.yml` to use GA v3.0.0 image for crm-sync
- Set project name: `alfred-ga-v3`
- Successfully pulled image: `ghcr.io/digital-native-ventures/alfred-agent-platform-v2/crm-sync:v3.0.0`

## Test Results

### ✅ Image Pull
```
crm-sync Pulled
Image: ghcr.io/digital-native-ventures/alfred-agent-platform-v2/crm-sync:v3.0.0
```

### ❌ Service Health
```
NAME       IMAGE                                                                      STATUS
crm-sync   ghcr.io/digital-native-ventures/alfred-agent-platform-v2/crm-sync:v3.0.0   Restarting (1)
```

### Issue Found
The service is failing to start due to an import error:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'models' from partially initialized module 'clients.hubspot_mock_client' 
(most likely due to a circular import) (/app/clients/hubspot_mock_client/__init__.py)
```

## Analysis
1. The GA v3.0.0 Docker image was successfully built and pushed to GHCR
2. The image can be pulled and deployed via Docker Compose
3. However, there's a Python import issue in the crm-sync service code that prevents it from starting

## Recommendation
This appears to be a code issue that needs to be fixed in the crm-sync service. The circular import in the HubSpot mock client needs to be resolved before the service can run properly.
