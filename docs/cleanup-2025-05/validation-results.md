# Port Configuration Validation Results

## Configuration Files Updated

1. **PORT-STANDARD.md**: Created as the single source of truth for port configuration
   - Mission Control UI: 3007
   - Social Intelligence Agent: 9000

2. **YouTube Workflows Documentation**:
   - environment-check-script.sh: Updated to check for port 3007
   - quick-start-guide.md: Updated to reference port 3007
   - implementation-plan.md: Updated with port 3007 configuration
   - implementation_status_final.md: Documented current port configuration
   - README.md: Added with standardized port information

3. **Troubleshooting Guide**:
   - PORT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Created with common port issues and solutions
   - verify-port-config.sh: Created to validate port configuration

## Validation Results

Based on our thorough analysis of the Alfred Agent Platform v2 codebase, we've confirmed:

1. **Mission Control UI**:
   - package.json: Configured for port 3007
   - .env.local: Contains NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3007
   - YouTube workflows service uses dynamic URL construction

2. **Social Intelligence Agent**:
   - Fixed at port 9000 as per requirements
   - All references to Social Intelligence Agent correctly use port 9000

3. **API Integration**:
   - Uses dynamic URL detection with window.location.origin
   - Fallback URLs set to correct ports
   - Multiple endpoint paths tried for better resilience
   - Robust error handling with mock data fallbacks

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Ensure all team members are aware of the standardized port configuration:
   - Mission Control UI: 3007
   - Social Intelligence Agent: 9000

2. Run the environment check script after any configuration changes:
   ```bash
   bash ./docs/phase6-mission-control/youtube-workflows/environment-check-script.sh
   ```

3. Reference PORT-STANDARD.md for all port-related questions

4. Use PORT-TROUBLESHOOTING.md when encountering port conflicts

## Conclusion

The port configuration has been standardized to prevent recurring conflicts. All documentation and code has been updated to reflect this standardization.

- **Mission Control UI**: 3007 (moved from 3000-3005 range to avoid conflicts)
- **Social Intelligence Agent**: 9000 (unchanged as required)

The dynamic URL detection in the YouTube workflows service ensures that the application will work regardless of the actual port used, providing flexibility while maintaining standardization.
