## ⚠️ Unhealthy but Running
Many services show as unhealthy but this may be due to:
1. Missing environment variables
2. Health check endpoints not properly configured
3. Dependencies on disabled services

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Core platform is operational with Slack integration working
2. ✅ Database and messaging infrastructure is healthy
3. ✅ New slack-bot v3.1.0 addresses previous instability issues

### Future Improvements
1. Fix health checks for auxiliary services
2. Consolidate more services following slack-bot pattern
3. Remove truly unused services from docker-compose.yml
4. Version all images properly (no :latest tags)

## Summary
The platform core is stable and functional. The Slack integration issue has been resolved with the new v3.1.0 consolidated service. Non-critical services have been disabled to ensure system stability.
