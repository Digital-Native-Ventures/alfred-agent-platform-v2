# UI-Chat GA Test Report

## Test Setup
- Attempted to use GA v3.0.0 image: `ghcr.io/digital-native-ventures/alfred-agent-platform-v2/ui-chat:v3.0.0`
- Project name: `alfred-ga-v3`

## Issues Found

### ‚ùå Missing from GA Release
The ui-chat service was not included in the docker-release.yml workflow matrix, so no v3.0.0 image was built/pushed.

### üîß Workaround Applied
1. Built local test image from source: `ui-chat-test:v3.0.0`
2. Fixed Dockerfile path issue: `COPY alfred/ui/streamlit_chat.py .`
3. Used local image in docker-compose.override.yml

### ‚ùå Service Health
```
NAME      IMAGE                 STATUS
ui-chat   ui-chat-test:v3.0.0   Restarting
```

Error: The streamlit command cannot find the file, likely due to command override conflicts.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing from Release**: ui-chat not included in docker-release.yml build matrix
2. **Dockerfile Context**: The Dockerfile expects to be built from repo root
3. **Command Override**: Conflicts between Dockerfile CMD and compose override

## Recommendations
1. Add ui-chat to the docker-release.yml workflow matrix:
   ```yaml
   - name: ui-chat
     dockerfile: ./alfred/ui/Dockerfile
     context: .
   ```
2. Fix the Dockerfile COPY paths for consistency
3. Build and push ui-chat as part of v3.0.1 patch release
