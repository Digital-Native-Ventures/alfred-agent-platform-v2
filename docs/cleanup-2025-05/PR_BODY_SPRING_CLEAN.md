‚úÖ Execution Summary

* Created ADR-002 for Spring-Clean initiative defining classification criteria
* Developed scripts_inventory.sh to generate complete repository file list
* Created Python classifier to automatically categorize files as USED or ORPHAN
* Generated complete inventory.csv with classifications for all 2,633 files
* Produced summary report with statistics and category analysis

## Classification Methodology

This PR implements the first phase (C-0/C-1) of the Spring-Clean initiative, classifying all repository files as either:

- **USED**: Files actively used in the current implementation (76.7% of files)
- **ORPHAN**: Files that appear to be unused or obsolete (23.3% of files)

The classification was performed using automated rules that include:

1. Path-based detection (backup/, cleanup-temp/, etc.)
2. File extension analysis (.bak, .backup, .old, etc.)
3. Date pattern identification (filenames with date stamps)
4. Directory-based classification (alfred/, .github/workflows/, etc.)
5. Root-level configuration identification

## Key Findings

The inventory identified 613 potentially orphaned files (23.3% of the repository), with major categories including:

1. **Backup Files**: ~200 files in backup/ directories or with backup extensions
2. **Redundant Documentation**: ~150 status reports and legacy phase documentation
3. **Legacy Configuration**: ~100 old docker-compose and environment files
4. **Deprecated Scripts**: ~80 one-off scripts from previous phases
5. **Redundant Code**: ~80 files with duplicate or superseded implementations

## Next Steps

This inventory provides a foundation for the upcoming Agent Consolidation & Naming Standard sprint by:

1. Identifying orphaned files that don't need renaming/refactoring
2. Highlighting areas for potential cleanup
3. Establishing patterns for consistent file organization

The detailed CSV can be used to:
- Prioritize cleanup tasks
- Inform refactoring decisions
- Guide archiving efforts
