‚úÖ Execution Summary

* Removed xfail marker from test_chains.py (fixes SC-330)
* Fixed LangChain mocking strategy to properly test async chains
* Updated testing approach to use proper patching instead of monkey patching
* Fixed model validation errors in test fixtures
* Made all tests properly handle async LLMChain operations

## Root Cause Analysis

The tests in `test_chains.py` were failing due to multiple issues:

1. Incompatible mocking approach - The previous tests tried to monkey-patch methods on LLMChain instances, but the LangChain API uses properties that can't be directly modified. The tests needed to use proper patch decorators instead.

2. Incorrect return format - The chain mocks needed to return text directly, not a dict with a "text" key.

3. Missing model fields - The tests were missing required fields in the request models, particularly in FinancialAnalysisRequest (custom_metrics needed to be a list) and TaxRateRequest (special_categories was required).

4. Nested dict in breakdown - The TaxCalculationResponse model expects breakdown.income to be a float, but the test was providing a nested dict.

The fix addresses these issues by:

1. Using proper `@patch` decorators to patch the LLMChain.ainvoke method at the appropriate level
2. Using a simplified mock_llm fixture that doesn't try to implement the complex Runnable interface
3. Patching LLMChain initialization to avoid validation errors
4. Fixing the test data to match the expected model structures
5. Adding missing required fields to request objects

This approach is more robust and maintainable as it isolates the tests from changes in the underlying LangChain library.
