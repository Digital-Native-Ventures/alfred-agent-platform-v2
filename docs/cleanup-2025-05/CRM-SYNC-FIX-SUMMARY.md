# CRM-Sync v3.0.1 Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
- **Issue**: #588 - crm-sync: circular import in hubspot_mock_client
- **PR**: #589 - fix: crm-sync import error

## Problem
The GA v3.0.0 release had a circular import issue in the crm-sync service that prevented it from starting:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'models' from partially initialized module 'clients.hubspot_mock_client'
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed __init__.py**: Created a mock models object with Contact class to resolve the circular import
2. **Updated Dockerfile**: Fixed the path to copy clients from the correct location
3. **Tested locally**: Service now starts successfully with health check passing

## Test Results
```bash
# Service status after fix
NAME       IMAGE                  STATUS                   PORTS
crm-sync   crm-sync-test:v3.0.1   Up 5 seconds (healthy)   0.0.0.0:8096->8000/tcp

# Health check
curl http://localhost:8096/healthz
{"status":"ok","ts":"2025-05-29T05:59:29.105211+00:00"}
```

## Next Steps
1. Review and merge PR #589
2. Build and push v3.0.1 patch release
3. Update docker-compose.override.yml to use v3.0.1
4. Tag and release v3.0.1 as a patch for GA
