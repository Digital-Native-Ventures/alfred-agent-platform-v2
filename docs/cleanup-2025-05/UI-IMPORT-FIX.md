# UI Import Path Resolution Fix

## Issue

The agent-orchestrator application was experiencing import errors when trying to use shared UI components:

```
Failed to resolve import "../shared-components/components/ui/animations/FadeIn" from "src/pages/YouTubeTestOnly.tsx". Does the file exist?
```

The issue stemmed from a mismatch between the symlink structure and the import paths used in the application code.

## Root Causes

1. **Inconsistent Path References**:
   - The application was using `../shared-components/components/...` but the actual symlink path was different
   - The symlink was set up as `src/shared-components -> ../../../shared`

2. **Lack of Path Aliasing**:
   - No standardized way to reference shared components
   - Relative imports break easily when file structure changes

## Solution

We implemented a more robust solution using path aliases:

1. **Added @shared Alias**:
   - Updated vite.config.ts to include a path alias for shared components:
   ```javascript
   resolve: {
     alias: {
       "@": path.resolve(__dirname, "./src"),
       "@shared": path.resolve(__dirname, "../shared"),
     },
   }
   ```
   - Also updated vitest.config.ts with the same alias for test files

2. **Updated Import Statements**:
   - Changed imports in YouTubeTestOnly.tsx to use the new alias:
   ```javascript
   import { FadeIn } from '@shared/components/ui/animations/FadeIn';
   import { GradientButton } from '@shared/components/ui/buttons/GradientButton';
   import NicheScoutVisualizer from '@shared/components/visualizations/NicheScoutVisualizer';
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All imports of shared components use the same pattern
2. **Maintainability**: Path aliases make imports clearer and easier to understand
3. **Resilience**: Imports won't break if file structure changes slightly
4. **IDE Support**: Better autocompletion and navigation in modern IDEs

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Update Remaining Files**:
   - Search for and update all files using the old import pattern
   - Common pattern: `../shared-components/components/...`

2. **Documentation**:
   - Add a note in README.md about the @shared alias
   - Update coding guidelines to use the alias for shared components

3. **Type Definitions**:
   - Ensure TypeScript path mappings are updated in tsconfig.json

4. **Testing**:
   - Verify all components still render correctly
   - Ensure tests pass with the new import paths

## Example Usage

Old approach (problematic):
```javascript
import { FadeIn } from '../shared-components/components/ui/animations/FadeIn';
// or
import { FadeIn } from '../../shared/components/ui/animations/FadeIn';
```

New approach (recommended):
```javascript
import { FadeIn } from '@shared/components/ui/animations/FadeIn';
```

This standardized approach will make the codebase more maintainable and reduce future import-related errors.
