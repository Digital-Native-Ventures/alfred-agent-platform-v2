✅ Execution Summary

* Removed 117 unnecessary blanket `# type: ignore` comments from Python files
* Created and executed a script to safely remove type ignores while ensuring mypy still passes
* Kept specific typed ignores with reason codes (e.g., `# type: ignore[import-not-found]`)
* All mypy checks still pass after the changes
