# Beta Deployment Status - v0.9.16-beta

## ‚úÖ Execution Summary

### Completed Tasks:
1. **Built healthcheck base image** - Successfully created and tagged locally
2. **Fixed docker-release workflow** - PR #462 merged with corrected build contexts
3. **Re-triggered docker builds** - Workflow initiated but encountering base image issues

### üß™ Output / Logs

#### Healthcheck Base Image Build
```bash
# Successfully built and tagged:
docker build -t ghcr.io/locotoki/alfred-agent-platform-v2/healthcheck:0.4.0 -f healthcheck/Dockerfile healthcheck/
docker tag ghcr.io/locotoki/alfred-agent-platform-v2/healthcheck:0.4.0 alfred/healthcheck:0.4.0
```

#### Docker Release Workflow Issues
The workflow is failing because:
1. **Base image references inconsistent** - Services use different registries:
   - `ghcr.io/alfred/healthcheck:0.4.0` (db-metrics)
   - `alfred/healthcheck:0.4.0` (social-intel, pubsub)
2. **Missing files in build context** - Some services expect files not present when building from tag
3. **Large LLM service image** - 1.71GB download causing timeouts

### üßæ Checklist

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Build healthcheck base image | ‚úÖ | Built locally, needs push to registry |
| Fix docker-release workflow | ‚úÖ | PR #462 merged |
| Re-run docker builds | ‚ö†Ô∏è  | Failing due to base image issues |
| Deploy full stack | ‚ùå | Blocked by image builds |
| Run soak test | ‚ùå | Blocked by deployment |

### üìç Next Required Action

#### Immediate Fixes Needed:
1. **Push healthcheck image to registry**:
   ```bash
   docker push ghcr.io/locotoki/alfred-agent-platform-v2/healthcheck:0.4.0
   ```

2. **Standardize base image references** - Update all Dockerfiles to use consistent registry:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM ghcr.io/locotoki/alfred-agent-platform-v2/healthcheck:0.4.0 AS healthcheck
   ```

3. **Fix missing file issues** - Either:
   - Include required files in service directories
   - Update Dockerfiles to handle missing files gracefully
   - Use build args to skip certain COPY commands during CI builds

#### Alternative Approach:
Since the full deployment is blocked, consider:
1. Using existing stable images for core services
2. Deploying a minimal stack for burn-rate monitoring validation
3. Running synthetic load tests against individual services

## üö® Blockers

1. **Registry Authentication** - Need proper GITHUB_TOKEN for pushing base images
2. **Dockerfile Inconsistencies** - Services expect different base image locations
3. **Missing Build Context Files** - package-lock.json, libs/, health.json not found
4. **Large Image Downloads** - LLM service (1.71GB) causing timeouts

## üìä Current State

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Functional but needs base image fixes
- **Local Images**: healthcheck:0.4.0 built locally
- **Workflow Runs**: 3 attempts, all failed due to base image issues
- **Services Ready**: agent-core available, others blocked

---

The beta deployment is partially complete but blocked by Docker image build issues that require standardization of base image references and registry authentication setup.
