## 6. Integration with Existing Platform Features

### LLM Integration

The family management system will leverage the existing LLM integration capabilities:

1. **Model Selection by Age Group:**
   - Children: Safer, more controlled models (TinyLlama, Llama2)
   - Teens: Standard models with content filtering (Llama3, GPT-3.5)
   - Adults: Full access to all models (GPT-4, Claude 3)

2. **Content Filtering:**
   - Implement preprocessing for prompts based on age
   - Use specialized system prompts for child-safe responses
   - Apply post-processing filters on responses

3. **Resource Usage Controls:**
   - Implement token limits by family role
   - Create usage allocation by family member
   - Track model usage by family for reporting

### Existing Authentication Flow

The implementation will extend the current authentication flow:

1. **Login Process:**
   - After standard authentication
   - Add family selection if user belongs to multiple families
   - Inject family context into session

2. **Token Enhancement:**
   - Extend JWT payload with family_id
   - Add family role to claims
   - Include family-specific permissions

3. **Authorization Middleware:**
   - Create family-aware middleware for all services
   - Implement role-based permission checks
   - Add age-appropriate content controls

## 7. Development Approach

### Tools and Technologies

The implementation will use the same tools as the existing platform:

- **Languages:** Python 3.11+ for backend, TypeScript/JavaScript for frontend
- **Frameworks:** FastAPI for APIs, React/Next.js for admin UI, Streamlit for chat UI
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Supabase extensions
- **Testing:** pytest with unit, integration, and e2e tests
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

### Development Practices

1. **Code Organization:**
   - Follow existing module structure
   - Create dedicated family modules in each service
   - Use clear separation of concerns

2. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Unit tests for all new components
   - Integration tests for service interaction
   - End-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - Security-focused tests for permission boundaries

3. **Feature Flags:**
   - Implement feature flags for all new capabilities
   - Allow gradual enablement of features
   - Support quick disabling if issues arise

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update API documentation
   - Create user and admin guides
   - Document security model

## 8. Deployment Strategy

The deployment will follow a phased approach:

1. **Development Environment:**
   - Deploy all changes for testing
   - Enable all features for developer evaluation
   - Run comprehensive test suite

2. **Staging Environment:**
   - Deploy with feature flags disabled
   - Enable features selectively for testing
   - Conduct security and performance tests

3. **Production Rollout:**
   - **Alpha Phase:** Small group of test families
   - **Beta Phase:** Expanded to more users
   - **General Availability:** All users with opt-in
   - **Full Deployment:** Default for all users
