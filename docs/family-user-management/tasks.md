## Getting Started

To begin work on the family user management system:

1. Review the [development plan document](./family-user-management.md)
2. Examine the [database schema](./family-user-management-schema.sql)
3. Set up a local development database with the family schema
4. Begin implementing the Phase 1 tasks above

All development should follow the existing project coding standards and practices. Coordinate with the team when making changes that affect existing functionality.
