# Family User Management System - Development Plan

**Document Status:** Draft  
**Last Updated:** May 11, 2025  
**Author:** Alfred Development Team

## Overview

This document outlines the development plan for implementing a comprehensive family user management system for the Alfred Agent Platform. The system will enable family members to have personalized experiences while allowing family administrators to manage access controls, shared resources, and parental restrictions.

## Business Requirements

1. **Multi-user Family Accounts**
   - Support for family groups with hierarchical relationships
   - Different permission levels based on family roles
   - Family resource sharing capabilities

2. **Personalization**
   - Per-user preferences and settings
   - Individual conversation history and context
   - Personalized agent behaviors and responses

3. **Parental Controls**
   - Content filtering options for children's accounts
   - Usage time and resource limits
   - Activity monitoring for parents

4. **Privacy and Security**
   - Clear separation between family members' data
   - Consent-based sharing of information
   - Age-appropriate content controls

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions

```sql
-- Family group table
CREATE TABLE family_groups (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Family membership with roles
CREATE TABLE family_members (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  family_id UUID REFERENCES family_groups(id),
  role TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'admin', 'parent', 'child', etc.
  restrictions JSONB, -- parental controls config
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, family_id)
);

-- Shared resources table
CREATE TABLE shared_resources (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  family_id UUID REFERENCES family_groups(id),
  resource_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'document', 'conversation', etc.
  resource_id UUID NOT NULL,
  permissions JSONB NOT NULL -- who can view/edit
);

-- User preferences table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) PRIMARY KEY,
  interface_preferences JSONB,
  agent_preferences JSONB,
  notification_settings JSONB,
  last_updated TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### API Endpoints

- `DELETE /api/shared-resources/{id}` - Delete shared resource

### UI Components

#### Admin Dashboard

- Family management interface

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Family Structure (Weeks 1-2)

- Implement database schema extensions
- Create basic family CRUD operations
- Implement user-to-family associations
- Build initial family admin UI

**Deliverables:**
- Family group creation and management API
- Member association and role assignment
- Basic admin dashboard UI

### Phase 2: User Personalization (Weeks 3-4)

- Implement user preferences system
- Create user settings UI
- Add personalization to existing agent interfaces
- Implement preference-based agent behavior

**Deliverables:**
- User preferences API
- Settings management UI
- Per-user agent behavior customization

### Phase 3: Parental Controls (Weeks 5-6)

- Implement restriction enforcement system
- Create parental control UI
- Add usage tracking and reporting
- Implement content filtering

**Deliverables:**
- Restriction enforcement middleware
- Parental control dashboard
- Usage reports and alerts
- Content filtering system

### Phase 4: Resource Sharing (Weeks 7-8)

- Implement shared resource system
- Create sharing UI
- Implement notifications for shared resources
- Add collaborative features

**Deliverables:**
- Resource sharing API
- Sharing management UI
- Notification system
- Collaborative workspace features

## Integration Points

### Authentication System

- Extend current authentication to support family-based access control
- Modify tokens to include family context and role information
- Add family-aware middleware to protected routes

### Agent Services

- Update agent-core to consider user preferences and restrictions
- Modify RAG services to respect family sharing permissions
- Add family context to conversation history

### Frontend Applications

- Update chat UI to display family context
- Add family selection to applicable interfaces
- Implement sharing controls in content creation flows

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test family group CRUD operations
   - Test permission enforcement logic
   - Test preference application

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test family-based access control
   - Test resource sharing across users
   - Test restriction enforcement

3. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Create test family groups
   - Verify personalization works as expected
   - Validate parental controls effectiveness

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Strict permission checking for all family operations
   - Prevent privilege escalation within families
   - Proper audit logging for sensitive operations

2. **Data Isolation**
   - Ensure complete isolation of user data unless explicitly shared
   - Implement proper purging when users leave families
   - Secure handling of parental monitoring data

3. **Privacy**
   - Clear consent mechanisms for sharing
   - Age-appropriate privacy controls
   - Transparency in monitoring and restrictions

## Deployment and Operations

1. **Database Migrations**
   - Versioned schema changes
   - Data backfill strategy for existing users

2. **Feature Flags**
   - Implement progressive rollout
   - Allow disabling features if issues arise

3. **Monitoring**
   - Family-specific usage metrics
   - Restriction enforcement auditing
   - Sharing activity monitoring

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Family Types**
   - Support for extended family structures
   - Friend groups and non-family sharing
   - Organization-based hierarchies

2. **Enhanced Controls**
   - Time-based access restrictions
   - Location-based permissions
   - Budget/resource allocation controls

3. **Family AI Features**
   - Family-wide knowledge bases
   - Shared learning across family members
   - Family activity coordination

## Conclusion

The family user management system will transform Alfred from a single-user experience to a family-oriented platform that respects the unique needs, preferences, and restrictions of each family member while enabling collaborative use of AI assistants in a household context.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize this plan with stakeholder feedback
2. Create detailed technical specifications
3. Set up project tracking in issue management system
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
