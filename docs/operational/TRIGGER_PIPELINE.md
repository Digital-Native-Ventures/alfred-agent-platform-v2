# CI Pipeline Trigger

This file is created to trigger a run of the CI Pipeline on the main branch.

Once the pipeline has run successfully, the CI Pipeline status check should appear in the branch protection rule settings dropdown.

After setting up the branch protection rule, you can safely delete this file.
