# Staging Validation Report

Date: 2025-05-26

## Summary

Staging validation was performed to test the production configurations before GA release.

## Docker Compose Validation

### ✅ Successes
- Production configuration structure is valid
- Resource limits defined for 11 services
- 12 secret references configured
- 7 services set with production environment
- Health checks remain at 100% coverage

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. **Environment Variables**: Need actual API keys for full deployment
   - Created `.env.staging` with test values
   - Real secrets required for production

2. **Image Dependencies**: Some services expect pre-built images
   - Services like `slack-mcp-gateway` need `image:` directive in prod override
   - Can use existing running services for validation

### Current Status
- 19 services currently running and healthy in development environment
- Production overlays add resource limits and security settings
- No breaking changes to existing health checks

## Helm Chart Validation

### ⚠️ Issues Found
1. **Missing Values**: `slackMcpGateway.service.type` not defined in prod values
2. **No Kubernetes Cluster**: Cannot perform full dry-run without cluster

### Recommendations
1. Add missing service configurations to `values-prod-complete.yaml`
2. Test against actual Kubernetes cluster during pre-release week
3. Validate each service template individually

## Action Items

### Before GA Release (July 11)
1. [ ] Complete Helm values for all services
2. [ ] Set up production secrets in secure vault
3. [ ] Test against staging Kubernetes cluster
4. [ ] Build and push all Docker images to registry
5. [ ] Validate TLS certificate provisioning

### Configuration Updates Needed
1. Add service definitions for Helm chart:
   ```yaml
   slackMcpGateway:
     service:
       type: ClusterIP
       port: 8084
   ```

2. Ensure all services in docker-compose have matching Helm templates

## Conclusion

The production configurations are structurally sound with proper resource limits, secrets management, and security settings. Minor adjustments needed for Helm values completeness. Recommend scheduling another validation session the week of July 7 with:

- Real staging environment with Kubernetes
- Pre-built Docker images
- Test API credentials
- TLS certificates ready

The platform remains on track for GA release on July 11, 2025.
