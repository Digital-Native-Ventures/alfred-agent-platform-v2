# Python Module Reorganization

## Background

During the health check standardization PR (#25), we encountered several Python module organization issues that complicated the CI process. These issues were temporarily worked around to allow the health check standardization to proceed, but are now being properly fixed in this dedicated PR.

## Changes Made

1. **Health Module Reorganization**
   - Converted the flat `health.py` file into a proper package structure
   - Created a proper separation of concerns with dedicated modules
   - Maintained backward compatibility for existing imports
   - Added comprehensive documentation

2. **Module Isolation**
   - Updated `pytest.ini` with proper module isolation settings
   - Added scripts to enforce correct module resolution
   - Created tools to standardize imports across the codebase

3. **CI Improvements**
   - Created a new Python-specific CI workflow
   - Removed temporary bypass configurations
   - Implemented proper validation for health module structure

4. **Documentation**
   - Added Python module organization guidelines
   - Documented import conventions and naming standards
   - Provided migration strategy for existing code

## Post-Merge Steps

After this PR is merged, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Remove Temporary CI Workarounds**
   - Run `scripts/cleanup-after-healthcheck-merge.sh` to remove temporary files
   - Push these changes to keep the repository clean

2. **Re-enable CI Requirements**
   - Update branch protection rules to re-enable strict requirements
   - Ensure all CI jobs are properly configured for the new module structure

3. **Continue Module Reorganization**
   - Identify and fix other areas with module shadowing issues
   - Apply the same patterns consistently across the codebase

## Testing

The refactored health module has been thoroughly tested to ensure compatibility:

- All test cases pass with the new module structure
- Service health endpoints continue to function correctly
- The module can be imported using both old and new paths

## Conclusion

This reorganization improves code quality, maintainability, and CI reliability. It establishes patterns that should be followed for future Python module development in the project.
