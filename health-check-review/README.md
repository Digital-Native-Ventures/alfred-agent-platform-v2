# Health Check Review for Alfred Agent Platform v2

## Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive review of the health check architecture implemented in Phase 0 of the Alfred Agent Platform v2. The review evaluates the current implementation, identifies strengths and areas for improvement, and provides recommendations for future enhancements.

## Contents

1. **HEALTH_CHECK_ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md** - Detailed review of the current health check implementation, including strengths, weaknesses, and future roadmap recommendations.

2. **HEALTH_CHECK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for implementing standardized health checks across all services, including code examples, configuration patterns, and best practices.

3. **HEALTH_CHECK_TEST_PLAN.md** - Detailed test plan for validating health check implementation, including test scenarios, procedures, and acceptance criteria.

4. **MONITORING_VALIDATION.md** - Comprehensive guide for validating the monitoring stack (Prometheus and Grafana).

5. **validate-health-checks.sh** - Utility script for validating health checks across all running services.

6. **scripts/validate-monitoring.sh** - Script to validate that Prometheus and Grafana are healthy.

## Key Findings

- The current implementation provides a solid foundation for service health monitoring
- Standardization using a static binary simplifies maintenance and improves reliability
- Areas for improvement include health check depth, scalability, and advanced health metrics
- A phased approach is recommended for evolving the health check architecture

## Using This Review

### For Developers

1. Reference the implementation guide when adding health checks to new services
2. Use the validation script to verify health check functionality
3. Follow the test plan to ensure comprehensive testing of health checks

### For Operators

1. Review the architecture document to understand the current implementation
2. Use the validation script for ongoing health check monitoring
3. Implement the suggested improvements as part of platform evolution

### For Architects

1. Use the roadmap recommendations to plan future health check enhancements
2. Incorporate health check standards into service design guidelines
3. Consider the migration path to Kubernetes-compatible health checks

## Quick Start

Run the validation script to check the current health check implementation:

```bash
./validate-health-checks.sh
```

This will test all running services and provide a report on health check configuration, binary availability, and current health status.

### Monitoring Validation

After the stack boots, run the monitoring validation script:

```bash
./scripts/validate-monitoring.sh
```

The script:
- Checks Prometheus `/-/healthy` and `/-/ready` endpoints
- Calls Grafana `/api/health` with the admin credentials
- Exits with code 1 if any component is unhealthy, so CI fails fast

This validation is integrated into the CI pipeline and Makefile's `phase0` target to ensure monitoring services are properly configured and running.

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize the recommended improvements
2. Implement enhanced health check responses with dependency status
3. Develop advanced monitoring dashboards based on health check data
4. Integrate health check validation into CI/CD pipelines
5. Prepare for transition to Kubernetes-compatible health checks
