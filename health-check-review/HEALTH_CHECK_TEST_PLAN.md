# Health Check Test Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for validating the health check implementation across all services in the Alfred Agent Platform v2.

## Test Objectives

1. Verify the correct implementation of health checks across all services
2. Validate health check responses under normal and failure conditions
3. Confirm proper integration with monitoring systems
4. Assess recovery behavior after service failures
5. Evaluate performance impact of health check mechanisms

## Test Environment

- **Development**: Local Docker Compose setup with all platform services
- **Testing Tools**: Custom test scripts, Docker CLI, Prometheus queries, Grafana dashboards
- **Prerequisites**: Platform fully deployed with health check implementation

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Health Check Validation

#### 1.1 Binary Availability Test

**Objective**: Verify the health check binary is correctly installed in all service containers

**Steps**:
1. For each service container, execute:
   ```bash
   docker exec <container_name> which healthcheck
   docker exec <container_name> healthcheck --version
   ```

2. Verify the binary is available at `/usr/local/bin/healthcheck` and executable

**Expected Results**:
- Binary path: `/usr/local/bin/healthcheck`
- Version matches expected (0.3.1)
- Execution permissions are correct

#### 1.2 HTTP Health Endpoint Test

**Objective**: Verify all HTTP services expose a working `/health` endpoint

**Steps**:
1. For each HTTP service, execute:
   ```bash
   docker exec <container_name> healthcheck --http http://localhost:<PORT>/health
   ```
   
2. Analyze the health response for:
   - Status code 200
   - JSON structure with at least `{"status": "healthy"}` 
   - Service name and version in the response

**Expected Results**:
- All services return a 200 status code
- Response contains the minimum required fields
- No errors or timeouts occur

### 2. Failure Detection Tests

#### 2.1 Dependency Failure Simulation

**Objective**: Verify health checks detect dependency failures

**Steps**:
1. For a test service with database dependency:
   - Stop the database container
   - Wait for the health check interval to pass
   - Check the health status of the dependent service

2. For a test service with cache dependency:
   - Stop the Redis container
   - Wait for the health check interval to pass
   - Check the health status of the dependent service

**Expected Results**:
- Services depending on the stopped database/cache report as unhealthy
- Health response includes dependency status information
- Docker service health status changes to `unhealthy`

#### 2.2 Service Resource Exhaustion Test

**Objective**: Verify health checks detect service resource issues

**Steps**:
1. For a test service:
   - Create a resource exhaustion condition (memory or CPU)
   - Wait for the health check interval to pass
   - Check health status

2. Testing methods:
   - Memory exhaustion: `docker exec <container_name> stress --vm 1 --vm-bytes 1G --timeout 60s`
   - CPU exhaustion: `docker exec <container_name> stress --cpu 4 --timeout 60s`

**Expected Results**:
- Service health status degrades
- Health response time increases but does not exceed timeout
- Health response may indicate resource constraints

### 3. Monitoring Integration Tests

#### 3.1 Prometheus Metric Collection Test

**Objective**: Verify Prometheus is collecting health metrics from all services

**Steps**:
1. Query Prometheus for up/down status of all services:
   ```
   up{job=~".*service"}
   ```

2. Verify all services appear in the result with value `1`

3. Stop a test service and verify the metric changes to `0`

**Expected Results**:
- All services report as up (`1`) in normal conditions
- Stopped service reports as down (`0`)
- Metrics update within expected time interval

#### 3.2 Grafana Dashboard Test

**Objective**: Verify Grafana dashboards correctly display health status

**Steps**:
1. Access the platform health dashboard in Grafana
2. Verify all services appear with correct status
3. Stop a test service and verify dashboard updates
4. Restart the service and verify dashboard updates again

**Expected Results**:
- Dashboard displays all services with correct status
- Status changes are reflected within expected time interval
- Dashboard UI elements update properly (colors, status indicators)

### 4. Recovery Behavior Tests

#### 4.1 Service Auto-Recovery Test

**Objective**: Verify services auto-recover based on health check status

**Steps**:
1. Configure Docker Compose with restart policy for a test service:
   ```yaml
   restart_policy:
     condition: on-failure
   ```

2. Induce a failure in the service
3. Monitor service restart behavior
4. Verify health check status after restart

**Expected Results**:
- Service restarts after consecutive failed health checks
- Health status returns to healthy after restart
- Service dependencies reconnect properly

#### 4.2 Graceful Degradation Test

**Objective**: Verify services with optional dependencies degrade gracefully

**Steps**:
1. Identify a service with optional dependencies
2. Stop the optional dependency service
3. Verify the primary service continues to report as healthy
4. Verify the health response indicates the specific dependency is unhealthy

**Expected Results**:
- Service continues to run and report as healthy overall
- Health response indicates specific dependency is unavailable
- Service functionality degrades gracefully (only affected features unavailable)

### 5. Performance Impact Tests

#### 5.1 Health Check Overhead Measurement

**Objective**: Measure the performance impact of health checks

**Steps**:
1. Measure baseline performance metrics (CPU, memory, response time)
2. Adjust health check frequency to a high value (every 1s)
3. Measure performance metrics with frequent health checks
4. Adjust health check frequency to a low value (every 60s)
5. Measure performance metrics with infrequent health checks

**Expected Results**:
- Performance impact is measurable but minimal
- Frequent health checks show increased resource usage
- Impact on service response time is minimal

#### 5.2 Concurrent Health Check Impact

**Objective**: Evaluate impact of synchronized health checks across many services

**Steps**:
1. Modify health check timing to synchronize across services
2. Measure resource utilization during synchronized health checks
3. Adjust health check timing to stagger across services
4. Measure resource utilization during staggered health checks

**Expected Results**:
- Synchronized health checks show higher peak resource usage
- Staggered health checks distribute resource usage more evenly
- No significant impact on platform availability in either scenario

## Test Implementation

### Automated Test Scripts

Create the following test scripts to automate testing:

1. **health-check-validation.sh**
   - Tests health check binary availability
   - Validates HTTP health endpoints
   - Checks response format and content

2. **dependency-failure-test.sh**
   - Simulates dependency failures
   - Monitors health status changes
   - Validates recovery behavior

3. **performance-impact-test.sh**
   - Measures baseline performance
   - Adjusts health check frequencies
   - Collects and analyzes metrics

### Test Data Collection

For each test, collect the following data:

1. Health check status before and after test actions
2. Response times for health check endpoints
3. Resource utilization during testing
4. Recovery times after failures
5. Prometheus metrics during test scenarios
