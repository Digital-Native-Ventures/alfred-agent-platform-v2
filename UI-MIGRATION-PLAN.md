# UI Migration Plan: Mission Control to Agent Orchestrator

This document outlines the strategy and implementation plan for migrating UI functionality from mission-control to the more modern agent-orchestrator implementation.

## Goals

1. Consolidate UI development efforts into a single codebase
2. Leverage the modern architecture of agent-orchestrator
3. Preserve UI improvements already implemented
4. Enable faster, more efficient UI iterations
5. Maintain feature parity during transition

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Status |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| 1: Setup & Analysis | 1-2 weeks | Feature inventory, shared components setup | Not started |
| 2: Core Migration | 2-4 weeks | Port UI improvements, implement missing features | Not started |
| 3: Transition | 4-8 weeks | Phase out mission-control UI, implement advanced features | Not started |

## Phase 1: Setup & Analysis (1-2 Weeks)

### Tasks

- [ ] Create feature parity checklist
- [ ] Identify UI components to migrate
- [ ] Set up shared component structure
- [ ] Create environment configuration for parallel development
- [ ] Develop shared design tokens system
- [ ] Implement development scripts for simultaneous testing

### Deliverables

- Feature parity matrix document
- Shared component library structure
- Development environment configuration
- Design tokens implementation

## Phase 2: Core Migration (2-4 Weeks)

### Tasks

- [ ] Migrate visual improvements (gradients, animations)
- [ ] Port UI enhancements from mission-control
- [ ] Implement missing workflow features
- [ ] Create shared API client for social-intel service
- [ ] Develop comprehensive style guide
- [ ] Add responsive layout improvements

### Deliverables

- Enhanced agent-orchestrator UI with visual improvements
- Complete workflow implementations
- Standardized API communication layer
- Documentation for UI components

## Phase 3: Transition (4-8 Weeks)

### Tasks

- [ ] Set up user redirection from mission-control to agent-orchestrator
- [ ] Implement advanced developer tools (Storybook, testing)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Final user acceptance testing
- [ ] Deprecation plan for mission-control UI

### Deliverables

- Production-ready agent-orchestrator UI
- Comprehensive documentation
- Performance reports
- Developer tooling

## Technical Implementation

### Shared Component Structure

```
/shared/
  /components/
    /ui/
      /cards/          # StatsCard, etc.
      /buttons/        # Gradient buttons
      /forms/          # Form controls
      /animations/     # Animation components
    /layout/           # Layout components
    /theme/            # Theming system
  /styles/
    /tokens/           # Design tokens
    /mixins/           # Style mixins/utilities
  /hooks/              # Shared React hooks
  /utils/              # Utility functions
```

### Design Tokens System

Implement a design tokens system that defines:
- Colors (including gradients)
- Typography
- Spacing
- Animation timing
- Shadows
- Border radiuses

This will ensure consistent styling across components and easy theme customization.

### API Client

Develop a standardized API client that:
- Handles communication with social-intel service
- Provides consistent error handling
- Supports mock data for offline development
- Includes type definitions for all responses

## Migration Strategy

1. **Parallel Development**: Continue using both UIs during transition
2. **Feature-by-Feature Migration**: Port features one at a time
3. **Test-Driven Approach**: Ensure each ported feature works before proceeding
4. **User-Centered**: Prioritize features based on user impact

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Feature regression | Comprehensive test suite, feature parity tracking |
| Performance issues | Regular performance testing, optimization reviews |
| API incompatibility | Shared API client with versioning support |
| User disruption | Gradual transition, option to switch between UIs |

## Success Criteria

- Complete feature parity with mission-control
- Improved developer experience (faster iterations)
- Enhanced user experience with modern UI components
- Comprehensive documentation and developer tools
- Performance meeting or exceeding current standards

## Resources

- Designer: UI/UX design support
- Developers: Frontend implementation
- QA: Testing and validation
- DevOps: Environment configuration

## Next Steps

1. Approve migration plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Create feature parity checklist
4. Begin implementing shared components
