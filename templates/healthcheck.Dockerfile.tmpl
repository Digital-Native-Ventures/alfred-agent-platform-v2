### ALFRED PLATFORM STANDARDIZED HEALTHCHECK TEMPLATE ###
# This template provides a standardized implementation of health checks
# It should be included in your service Dockerfile with minimal modification

# First stage: Get the healthcheck binary
FROM gcr.io/distroless/static-debian12:nonroot AS healthcheck
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=ghcr.io/alfred-health/healthcheck:latest /usr/local/bin/healthcheck /usr/local/bin/healthcheck

# Main application stage
FROM ${BASE_IMAGE} AS app

# Install healthcheck binary from first stage
COPY --from=healthcheck /usr/local/bin/healthcheck /usr/local/bin/healthcheck

# Set up health check environment variables
# These variables can be customized per service but defaults are provided
ENV HEALTH_CHECK_PORT=8080
ENV HEALTH_CHECK_PATH=/health
ENV HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL=30s
ENV METRICS_EXPORTER_PORT=9091

# Set healthcheck command with standard parameters
# --export-prom: Export Prometheus metrics on the specified port
# --interval: How often to check the health endpoint
# --port and --path: Where to reach the service's health endpoint
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=5s --start-period=10s --retries=3 \
    CMD ["/usr/local/bin/healthcheck", \
         "--export-prom", ":${METRICS_EXPORTER_PORT}", \
         "--interval", "${HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL}", \
         "--port", "${HEALTH_CHECK_PORT}", \
         "--path", "${HEALTH_CHECK_PATH}"]

# ENTRYPOINT and CMD should be defined in the service-specific Dockerfile
# ENTRYPOINT ["/path/to/entrypoint.sh"]
# CMD ["command", "arg1", "arg2"]
