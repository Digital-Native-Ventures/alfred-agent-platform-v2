## Timestamp: 2025-05-15 22:00 UTC

## Prometheus Targets Status

All DB metrics targets are UP:

- db-admin-metrics:9091 - **UP**
- db-api-metrics:9091 - **UP**
- db-auth-metrics:9091 - **UP**
- db-realtime-metrics:9091 - **UP**
- db-storage-metrics:9091 - **UP**

## Metrics Validation

1. **Service Request Totals**:
   - db-admin: 5,724 requests
   - db-api: 5,724 requests
   - db-auth: 5,724 requests
   - db-realtime: 5,724 requests
   - db-storage: 5,725 requests

2. **DB Connection Errors**: 
   - No connection errors recorded (`db_connection_errors_total` returns empty result)

3. **Health Status**:
   - All metrics endpoints responding with 200 OK on /health and /healthz

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring every 3 hours as scheduled (T+3h, T+6h, T+9h)
- Track any changes in connection errors or metrics service health
- Check for alerts in Prometheus related to DB metrics services
- Submit final report at T+12h

## Notes

- All services have stable metrics counts showing regular scraping
- Services appear to have been running for several hours without errors
- Port standardization on 9091 for metrics is working as expected
- No Grafana dashboard access yet - waiting on staging cluster credentials
