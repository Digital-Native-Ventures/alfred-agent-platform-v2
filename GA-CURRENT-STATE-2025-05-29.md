## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Complete v3.0.1 Patch Release (TODAY)
```bash
# After merging PR #589:
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t ghcr.io/digital-native-ventures/alfred-agent-platform-v2/crm-sync:v3.0.1 \
  --push -f services/crm-sync/Dockerfile .

# Tag v3.0.1 release
git tag -a v3.0.1 -m "Patch release: Fix import errors in agent-bizops, contact-ingest, crm-sync"
git push origin v3.0.1
```

### 2. Local Validation (1 HOUR)
```bash
# Test the v3.0.1 stack
TAG=v3.0.1 docker compose up -d \
  agent-core agent-bizops contact-ingest slack-adapter crm-sync db-metrics

# Verify all services healthy
docker compose ps
for service in agent-core agent-bizops contact-ingest slack-adapter crm-sync db-metrics; do
  echo "=== $service ==="
  docker compose logs $service --tail 50 | grep -E "(ERROR|error|Error|started|ready|healthy)"
done
```

### 3. Staging Deployment (TOMORROW)
```bash
# Update Helm values
helm upgrade alfred-staging ./charts/alfred \
  --set global.image.tag=v3.0.1 \
  --namespace staging \
  --wait --timeout 10m

# Run smoke tests
kubectl -n staging get pods
kubectl -n staging logs -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=alfred-staging --tail=100
```

### 4. Production Deployment (DAY 3)
- Create deployment checklist
- Schedule maintenance window
- Deploy with rollback plan ready

## Missing from GA Workflow

The following services need to be added to `.github/workflows/docker-release.yml`:
- ui-chat
- ui-admin
- agent-atlas
- hubspot-mock
- model-registry
- model-router

## Risk Assessment

1. **CRITICAL**: crm-sync not functional until v3.0.1
2. **HIGH**: No automated testing for import errors
3. **MEDIUM**: Missing services from GA workflow
4. **LOW**: Documentation PRs still open

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All 6 core services running without errors
- [ ] Health checks passing for 30+ minutes
- [ ] No import errors in logs
- [ ] Prometheus metrics being collected
- [ ] Slack integration responding to commands

## Recommendations

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Merge PR #589 and complete v3.0.1
2. **TODAY**: Deploy v3.0.1 stack locally for validation
3. **TOMORROW**: Stage deployment with monitoring
4. **THIS WEEK**: Update GA workflow with missing services
5. **FUTURE**: Add import validation to CI pipeline

## Current Docker Compose State

```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml exists but all services are stopped
# Ready to deploy v3.0.1 once crm-sync is built
```
