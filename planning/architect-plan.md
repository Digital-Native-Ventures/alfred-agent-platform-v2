```
# Architect reliability
- Broaden architect_generate trigger: run on push to main when planning/** changes
- Switch architect_generate push step to use ARCHITECT_PAT token

- Add architect_watchdog workflow: open GitHub Issue if planning has unchecked bullets but no successful architect_generate run in >30 min

# Engineer reliability
- Add pre-flight ruff + pytest step in engineer_async; abort PR creation on failure

# Reviewer & linting
- Add Reviewer agent workflow: helm lint and repo-wide conventions; auto-push fixes before CI

# Planner / PRD flow
- Create Planner agent workflow: generate PRD markdown for bullets labelled needs-spec; iterate Q&A; merge when label spec-approved is added
- Update engineer_async guard: skip task until matching spec-approved PRD file exists

# Docs
- Update CONTRIBUTING.md to document needs-spec / spec-approved labels and new workflows
