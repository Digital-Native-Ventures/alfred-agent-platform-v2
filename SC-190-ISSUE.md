# Chore SC-190 · Repo-wide Black Formatting Pass

## Description

Multiple PRs are failing CI due to the Black formatter check. This issue tracks running Black formatter across the entire repository as a dedicated PR to resolve formatting inconsistencies once and for all.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Run Black formatter on all Python files in the repo
- [ ] Fix any formatting issues identified by Black
- [ ] Ensure CI passes on the formatting PR
- [ ] No functional code changes, only style formatting

## Related Issues

This issue will unblock:
- PR #186 (Compose generator fixes)

## Implementation Notes

- We already have `run-black-format.py` and `scripts/format-with-black.sh` that can be used
- This should be a purely mechanical formatting pass
- Black version: 24.1.1 (latest)
- Total files to format: 138 Python files

## Steps to Reproduce

For anyone working on this issue, here are the steps to resolve it:

```bash
# 0 · Create branch
git switch -c chore/black-pass-2025-05

# 1 · Run Black formatter across repo
python run-black-format.py   # or: ./scripts/format-with-black.sh

# 2 · Re-run Tier-0 locally
make pre-commit              # Black, Ruff, Flake8, forbid services.*

# 3 · Commit changes
git add -u
git commit -m "chore: run Black across codebase (Closes #190)"

# 4 · Push branch & open PR
git push -u origin chore/black-pass-2025-05
gh pr create --title "chore: repo-wide Black formatting pass" \
             --body "Closes #190\n\nPurely mechanical reformat using Black 24.4.2.\nNo functional code changes." \
             --label chore,style

# 5 · Notify Architect for bulk-diff review
echo "Ready for @alfred-architect-o3 review"
```

## Priority
