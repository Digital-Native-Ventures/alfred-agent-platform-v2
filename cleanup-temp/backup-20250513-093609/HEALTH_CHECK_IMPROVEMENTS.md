# Health Check Improvements for Alfred Agent Platform

This document summarizes the improvements made to health check configurations across the platform to improve service stability and reliability.

## 1. Health Check Standardization

### Issues Identified:
- Inconsistent health check endpoints (`/healthz` vs `/health`)
- Overly strict health check parameters (timeouts, retries)
- Incorrect URL patterns in health check commands (e.g., `localhost:localhost`)
- Missing health check tools in some containers (wget, curl, nc)

### Improvements Made:

#### 1.1 Standardized Health Check Settings
Updated both `docker-compose-clean.yml` and `docker-compose-optimized.yml` with more lenient health check settings:

```yaml
x-health-check-settings: &basic-health-check
  interval: 30s    # Increased from 10s
  timeout: 20s     # Increased from 5s
  retries: 5       # Increased from 3
  start_period: 45s # Increased from 30s
```

#### 1.2 Standardized Health Check Endpoints
- Unified all health check endpoints to `/health` (previously some used `/healthz`)
- Fixed incorrect URL patterns in health check commands:
  - Replaced `localhost:localhost` with `localhost`
  - Corrected doubled endpoints like `/healthzhealth` to `/health`

#### 1.3 Added Parallel Health Endpoints
Created a patch script to add `/health` endpoints to services that only have `/healthz`, ensuring backward compatibility without breaking existing clients.

## 2. Service Credential Fixes

### Issues Identified:
- Missing or inaccessible credentials file needed by multiple agent services

### Improvements Made:
- Created consistent location for empty credential files: `config/credentials/empty-credentials.json`
- Updated volume mounts in Docker Compose files to use the consistent credential file location

## 3. Scripts Created

The following utility scripts were created to implement and verify these improvements:

1. `scripts/fix-health-endpoints-specific.sh` - Fixes specific health check issues in docker-compose-clean.yml
2. `scripts/improve-health-checks-optimized.sh` - Updates health check settings in docker-compose-optimized.yml
3. `scripts/verify-service-health.sh` - Verifies the health status of all services
4. `patches/add-health-endpoints.py` - Adds `/health` endpoints to services that only have `/healthz`

## 4. Remaining Issues and Recommendations

### 4.1 Missing Health Check Tools

During verification, we identified that several container images lack the necessary health check tools:

- Some containers lack `wget` for HTTP endpoint checking
- Some containers lack `curl` for API endpoint verification
- Some containers lack `nc` (netcat) for port connectivity checks

This causes health checks to fail with errors like:
```
/bin/sh: 1: wget: not found
/bin/sh: 1: curl: not found
bash: line 1: nc: command not found
```

### 4.2 Recommendations for Long-Term Fixes

To properly address these issues, consider the following approaches:

1. **Add Health Check Tools to Images**:
   - Update Dockerfiles to install necessary tools (wget, curl, netcat-openbsd)
   - Example: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget curl netcat-openbsd`

2. **Use Basic Process Checks Instead**:
   - For minimum viability, use process existence checks rather than HTTP checks:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pidof <process-name> || exit 1"]
     # or even simpler
     test: ["CMD-SHELL", "test -f /proc/1/status || exit 1"]
   ```

3. **Implement a Health Check Proxy Container**:
   - Deploy a dedicated container with all required tools
   - Configure it to forward health checks to target services
   - All health checks go through this container

4. **Implement a Readiness vs. Liveness Strategy**:
   - For Kubernetes: Use simple process checks for liveness, HTTP checks for readiness
   - For Docker Compose: Set longer health check intervals and more retries

## 5. Verification Process

To verify these improvements:

1. Check service health with the verification script:
   ```
   ./scripts/verify-service-health.sh
   ```

2. Restart services to apply configuration changes:
   ```
   echo y | ./start-platform.sh -a restart
   ```

## 6. Next Steps

1. Consider implementing a more robust health check system that includes:
   - Deeper health checks that verify database connections
   - Readiness vs. liveness probes for Kubernetes
   - Centralized health monitoring with alerting

2. Add documentation for service maintainers on implementing proper health checks for new services:
   - Include health check tools in Docker images
   - Standardize on /health endpoint
   - Implement both basic and deep health checks

3. Implement auto-recovery mechanisms for services that frequently experience health issues

These improvements contribute to a more stable and reliable Alfred Agent Platform, reducing false negative health check failures and providing more time for services to initialize properly.
