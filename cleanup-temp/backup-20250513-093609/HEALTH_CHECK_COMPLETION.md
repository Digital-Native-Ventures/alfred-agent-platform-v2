# Health Check Improvements Project Summary

## Overview

We've completed a comprehensive review and improvement of the health check configurations for the Alfred Agent Platform v2. This document summarizes the work done, current status, and recommended next steps.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Health Check Configuration Improvements**
   - Standardized on `/health` endpoints across all services
   - Increased timeouts and retries for more resilient checks
   - Fixed incorrect URL patterns (localhost:localhost → localhost, /healthzhealth → /health)
   - Created temporary solution to disable failing health checks for development

2. **Configuration File Updates**
   - Updated `docker-compose-clean.yml` with standardized health check parameters
   - Updated `docker-compose-optimized.yml` with standardized parameters and resource constraints
   - Fixed credential file paths and created consistent location at `config/credentials/empty-credentials.json`

3. **Created New Utility Scripts**
   - `scripts/fix-health-endpoints-specific.sh` - Fixes specific health check issues
   - `scripts/improve-health-checks-optimized.sh` - Updates optimized Docker Compose file
   - `scripts/verify-service-health.sh` - Checks health status of all services
   - `scripts/disable-health-checks.sh` - Temporarily disables health checks for development
   - `scripts/restore-health-checks.sh` - Restores health checks from backup files
   - `patches/add-health-endpoints.py` - Adds `/health` endpoints to services that only have `/healthz`

4. **Created Documentation**
   - `HEALTH_CHECK_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Detailed technical documentation
   - `HEALTH_CHECK_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary with recommendations
   - `HEALTH_CHECK_COMPLETION.md` (this document)

## Current Status

After applying our improvements:

- **Core Infrastructure**: Mostly working (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **LLM Services**: Partially working (Model Registry, Model Router responding)
- **Agent Services**: Not responding to API calls (needs further investigation)
- **Health Check Status**: Still showing as unhealthy for many containers due to missing tools

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Term (Development)
1. Use `disable-health-checks.sh` to prevent restart loops during development
2. Focus on troubleshooting agent services connectivity issues
3. Install health check tools (wget, curl, netcat) in critical containers

### Medium Term
1. Update Dockerfiles to include health check tools in all container images
2. Implement simpler health check methods for containers without proper tools
3. Create a health check hierarchy (basic process check → HTTP check → deep check)

### Long Term
1. Implement a dedicated health check system/proxy
2. Move to Kubernetes-style readiness/liveness probes
3. Develop centralized health monitoring with alerting

## Major Achievements
- Identified root causes of health check failures (missing tools, incorrect URLs)
- Made health checks more lenient to prevent restart loops
- Standardized health check endpoints across services
- Established proper credential file handling
- Documented comprehensive recommendations for long-term improvements

The platform is now more stable with core infrastructure services functioning correctly. Further work is needed on agent services, but the foundation has been laid for a robust health check system.
