=================================================================
Health Check Standardization Complete!
=================================================================

Changes made:
1. Updated Docker Compose health checks to use /health endpoint
2. Created a patch script to add /health endpoints to services

Next steps:
1. Run the patch script to update service code:
   python3 /home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/patches/add-health-endpoints.py

2. Restart services to apply configuration changes:
   ./start-platform.sh -a restart

NOTE: Services may still show as unhealthy if they don't
      implement the /health endpoint. Check the logs and
      manually update those services as needed.
