# LLM Integration Summary

## Implemented Services

1. **Model Registry**
   - Status: ✅ Deployed
   - Endpoint: http://localhost:8079
   - Features:
     - Stores model metadata, capabilities, and parameters
     - API endpoints for CRUD operations
     - Default models loaded from configuration
     - Manual model registration working
   - Issues:
     - Automatic discovery has errors with response handling
     - Custom discovery endpoint added to trigger discovery

2. **Model Router**
   - Status: ✅ Deployed
   - Endpoint: http://localhost:8080
   - Features:
     - Fetches models from Model Registry
     - Provides routing based on model capabilities
     - API endpoints for model selection and routing
   - Working as expected

3. **Ollama LLM Service**
   - Status: ✅ Deployed
   - Endpoint: http://localhost:11434
   - Models:
     - llama2 ✅ Loaded
     - tinyllama ✅ Loaded
   - Working as expected

4. **Streamlit UI**
   - Status: ✅ Deployed
   - Endpoint: http://localhost:8502
   - Features:
     - Chat interface for interacting with models
     - Model selection dropdown
     - Fallback to hardcoded models if registry is unavailable
   - Should be connected to the Model Registry and Router

## Database Setup

- PostgreSQL is running and initialized
- Model Registry schema is created
- Models are registered in the database

## Models Available

1. **Default Models:**
   - GPT-4o (OpenAI)
   - GPT-4.1-mini (OpenAI)
   - GPT-4.1 (OpenAI)
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo (OpenAI)
   - Llama 3 (8B) (Ollama)
   - Llama 3 (70B) (Ollama)
   - CodeLlama (Ollama)
   - LLaVA (Ollama)
   - Claude 3 Opus (Anthropic)
   - Claude 3 Sonnet (Anthropic)

2. **Added Models:**
   - TinyLlama (Ollama)
   - Llama 2 (Ollama)

## Issues and Solutions

1. **Model Discovery Issues**
   - Problem: The discovery service throws errors when trying to access streaming response content
   - Solution: Manually added models to the registry
   - Future fix: Update the discovery service to properly handle HTTP responses

2. **API Path Issues**
   - Problem: The discovery endpoint had an incorrect path structure
   - Solution: Used the correct endpoint path for triggering discovery

## Next Steps

1. **Test Streamlit UI with Ollama Models**
   - Verify that TinyLlama and Llama 2 models appear in the UI dropdown
   - Test chat functionality with these models

2. **Fix Model Discovery**
   - Debug and fix the response handling issue in the discovery service
   - Enable automatic model discovery for easier model management

3. **Add Model Endpoints**
   - Configure proper endpoint URLs for each model
   - Set up authentication if needed

4. **Configure Model Router Rules**
   - Set up rules for intelligent model routing based on content and task type
   - Configure fallback behavior

5. **Documentation**
   - Document the overall architecture
   - Create usage guides for developers
   - Document the API endpoints

## Deployment Script

The script `/home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/deploy-llm-integration.sh` can be used to deploy all the LLM integration services. It sets up the following:

1. Model Registry service
2. Model Router service
3. Ollama LLM service
4. Streamlit UI

## Model Loading Script

The script `/home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/setup-ollama-models.sh` can be used to pull models into Ollama. It's recommended to use non-interactive docker exec commands to pull models:

```bash
docker exec -i alfred-ollama ollama pull tinyllama
docker exec -i alfred-ollama ollama pull llama2
```
