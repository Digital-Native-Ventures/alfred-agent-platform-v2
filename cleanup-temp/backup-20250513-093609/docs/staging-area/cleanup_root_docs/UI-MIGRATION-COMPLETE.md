## Migration Summary

The UI migration from mission-control to agent-orchestrator is now complete. We have successfully transferred all the visual improvements while leveraging the superior architecture of agent-orchestrator. The application now features:

1. **Modern Visual Design**: Gradients, animations, and enhanced visual hierarchy
2. **Improved User Experience**: Smoother transitions and better feedback
3. **Consistent Design Language**: Unified styling across all components
4. **Better Data Visualization**: Enhanced charts and data presentation

All these improvements build on the solid foundation of agent-orchestrator's component architecture, creating a more maintainable and extensible codebase.

## Next Steps

With the migration complete, future development should focus on:

1. ✅ Unit testing the shared components (Completed)
2. Documentation of the shared design system
3. Performance optimization for large datasets

The development environment setup allows for side-by-side comparison during ongoing development.

### Unit Testing Progress

We have implemented comprehensive unit tests for the following shared components:

- FadeIn animation component
- GradientButton component
- GradientProgressBar component
- StatsCard component

All tests are passing successfully, with 42 tests covering various aspects of these components. See the UNIT-TESTING-SUMMARY.md and UI-COMPONENTS-TESTING.md files for more details on the testing implementation.
