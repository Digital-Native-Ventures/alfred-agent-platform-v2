# Agent Services Fix Summary

This document summarizes the issues that were fixed for the agent-financial and agent-legal services, and how the solutions were implemented.

## Issues Encountered

1. **Missing Intent Constants**
   - The agent-financial and agent-legal modules lacked intent constants
   - This caused import errors when initializing the agent classes

2. **Missing PyJWT Dependency**
   - Both services required the PyJWT package for authentication
   - This caused `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'jwt'` errors

3. **FastAPI Response Model Inference Issues**
   - FastAPI was attempting to use request model classes as response models
   - This caused errors: `Invalid args for response field!`

4. **Docker Network Configuration**
   - The alfred-network needed to be marked as external in docker-compose.yml
   - This resolved network warnings during startup

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Intent Constants

Added the necessary intent constants to both agent modules:

```python
# In agents/financial_tax/__init__.py
TAX_CALCULATION = "tax_calculation"
FINANCIAL_ANALYSIS = "financial_analysis"
TAX_COMPLIANCE_CHECK = "tax_compliance_check"
RATE_SHEET_LOOKUP = "rate_sheet_lookup"

# In agents/legal_compliance/__init__.py
COMPLIANCE_AUDIT = "compliance_audit"
DOCUMENT_ANALYSIS = "document_analysis"
REGULATION_CHECK = "regulation_check"
CONTRACT_REVIEW = "contract_review"
```

### 2. Added PyJWT to Dockerfiles

Updated both Dockerfiles to install PyJWT:

```dockerfile
# Added to both Dockerfiles
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir PyJWT==2.8.0
```

### 3. Fixed FastAPI Route Decorators

Modified all API route decorators to include `response_model=None`:

```python
# Before
@app.post("/api/v1/financial-tax/calculate-tax")
async def calculate_tax(...):
    # Function body

# After
@app.post("/api/v1/financial-tax/calculate-tax", response_model=None)
async def calculate_tax(...):
    # Function body
```

### 4. Updated Docker Network Configuration

Modified the docker-compose.yml file to mark the alfred-network as external:

```yaml
networks:
  alfred-network:
    name: alfred-network
    driver: bridge
    external: true
```

## Verification

The fixes were verified by:

1. Rebuilding both service images with `docker-compose build --no-cache agent-financial agent-legal`
2. Starting the services with `docker-compose up -d agent-financial agent-legal`
3. Confirming the services are running with `docker ps`
4. Checking the service logs for successful startup messages
5. Testing the health endpoints with `curl -s http://localhost:9003/health/` and `curl -s http://localhost:9002/health/`

Both services now start successfully and respond to health check requests with proper JSON responses.

## Documentation Created

Two new documentation files were created:

1. **AGENT_SERVICE_INTEGRATION.md**: A guide for integrating new agent services with requirements and best practices.
2. **AGENT_FIXES_SUMMARY.md**: This summary document detailing the issues and fixes implemented.

A link to the new integration guide was also added to the main README.md file.

## Recommended Follow-up Actions

1. Review all agent service Dockerfiles to ensure they include PyJWT
2. Check all FastAPI routes to ensure they use `response_model=None` when appropriate
3. Update CI/CD pipeline to verify dependencies are installed correctly
4. Add automated testing for agent service health endpoints
