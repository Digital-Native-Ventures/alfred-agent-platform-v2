# Alfred Agent Platform v2 - Root Directory Cleanup

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup and organization of the Alfred Agent Platform v2 root directory performed on May 12, 2025. The goal was to reduce clutter, improve maintainability, and create a more organized directory structure.

## Actions Performed

### Documentation Consolidation

All documentation markdown files (90+ files) were moved from the root directory to:
```
docs/staging-area/cleanup_root_docs/
```

This consolidation aligns with the ongoing document consolidation project.

### Script Organization

Utility scripts were organized into appropriate directories:

```
scripts/
├── db/              # Database-related scripts and SQL files
├── niche-scout/     # Niche Scout specific scripts and data
├── setup/           # Setup and initialization scripts
├── tests/           # Test scripts
├── utils/           # General utility scripts
│   └── llm/         # LLM-specific utilities
├── web/             # Web-related files (HTML, etc.)
└── youtube/         # YouTube-related scripts
```

### Configuration Organization

Environment and configuration files were organized:

```
config/
├── env/             # Environment configuration files (.env.*)
└── postgres/        # PostgreSQL configuration
```

### Log Files Organization

Log files and text records were consolidated:

```
logs/
├── doc-reference-update-log.txt
├── doc-rename-log.txt
├── jwt_tokens.txt
├── rag-build.log
└── test-inputs.txt
```

### Backup

All moved files were backed up to:
```
./cleanup_backup_20250512/
```

## Current Root Directory Contents

The root directory now contains only essential files:

1. **Core Docker Files**:
   - `docker-compose-clean.yml` - Primary Docker Compose configuration
   - `docker-compose-optimized.yml` - Optimized Docker Compose configuration
   - `docker-compose/` - Directory for environment-specific overrides

2. **Core Scripts**:
   - `start-platform.sh` - Main platform management script
   - `check-env-vars.sh` - Environment variable validation script
   - `verify-platform.sh` - Platform verification tool

3. **Configuration Files**:
   - `.env` - Main environment variables file
   - `.env.example` - Example environment variables file

4. **Documentation**:
   - `README.md` - Updated to reflect new organization
   - `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
   - `SECURITY.md` - Security policies
   - `LICENSE` - License information
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Claude AI assistant instructions

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory reduced from 140+ files to ~20 essential files
2. **Improved Navigation**: Related files grouped together logically
3. **Better Maintainability**: Easier to find and update specific files
4. **Clear Organization**: Structured directory layout that follows standard practices
5. **Documentation Consolidation**: All documentation in a single location for easier reference

## Next Steps

1. The documentation team may want to further organize files within `docs/staging-area/cleanup_root_docs/`
2. Consider adding an index file to help navigate the documentation
3. Update any internal references that might be pointing to the old file locations
4. Once the document consolidation project is complete, remove any redundant files
