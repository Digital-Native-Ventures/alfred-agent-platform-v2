# Migration Complete

The Docker Compose configuration has been successfully refactored and migrated to the new structure. All configuration files and scripts have been installed to the main project directory.

## Completed Steps

- ✅ Backup of existing files created at `/home/locotoki/projects/alfred-agent-platform-v2/backup_20250511_164713`
- ✅ All Docker Compose files copied to the main project directory
- ✅ Alfred management script installed
- ✅ Documentation files copied
- ✅ Test scripts installed
- ✅ Configuration validated successfully

## Next Steps for Production Deployment

To fully deploy the new configuration in your production environment, you need to:

1. **Organize Service Code**:
   - Ensure all service code is in the expected locations
   - Check build contexts in docker-compose files match your service directories

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Update your `.env` file with all required API keys and credentials
   - Check that all paths in volume mounts are correct

3. **Network Setup**:
   - The network `alfred-network` is now used consistently across all services
   - Make sure any external services can connect to this network if needed

4. **Start Services Gradually**:
   ```bash
   # Start with core services first
   ./alfred.sh start --components=core

   # Once those are stable, add agents
   ./alfred.sh start --components=core,agents

   # Finally, add UI and monitoring
   ./alfred.sh start --components=core,agents,ui,monitoring
   ```

5. **Monitor Service Health**:
   ```bash
   # Check service status
   ./alfred.sh status

   # View logs
   ./alfred.sh logs --service=service-name
   ```

If you encounter any issues, you can always roll back to the previous configuration from the backup directory.
