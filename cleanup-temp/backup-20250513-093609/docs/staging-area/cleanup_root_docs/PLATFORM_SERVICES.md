    - Depends on agent-core

21. **ui-chat** (Chat Interface)
    - User-facing chat interface
    - Depends on agent-core

    - User login and registration interface
    - Works with db-auth
    - Critical component of the auth system

## Monitoring Services

23. **monitoring-metrics** (Prometheus)
    - Collects and stores metrics

25. **monitoring-node** (Node Exporter)
    - Exports system metrics
    - Provides host-level monitoring

26. **monitoring-db** (Postgres Exporter)
    - Exports PostgreSQL metrics
    - Requires authentication to postgres

## Recommended Startup Order

For proper startup, services should be started in the following order:

1. Core Infrastructure (redis, vector-db, pubsub-emulator, alfred-postgres, mail-server)
2. Database Services (db-auth, db-api, db-realtime, db-storage, db-admin)
3. Model Services (alfred-ollama, alfred-model-registry, alfred-model-router)
4. Agent Services (agent-rag, agent-core, agent-atlas, agent-financial, agent-legal, agent-social)
5. UI Services (ui-admin, ui-chat, auth-ui)
6. Monitoring Services (monitoring-metrics, monitoring-dashboard, monitoring-node, monitoring-db)

## Shutdown Order

For proper shutdown, services should be stopped in the reverse order:

1. UI Services
2. Agent Services
3. Model Services
4. Monitoring Services
5. Database Services
6. Mail Service
7. Core Infrastructure

This ordered approach ensures dependencies are properly respected during startup and shutdown.
