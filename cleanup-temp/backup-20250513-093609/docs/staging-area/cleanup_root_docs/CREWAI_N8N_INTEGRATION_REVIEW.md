# CrewAI and n8n Integration Review

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive review of the CrewAI and n8n integration with the Alfred Agent Platform v2. The integration enhances the platform with multi-agent orchestration and visual workflow automation capabilities, completing a major enhancement to the platform's architecture.

## Implementation Summary

The integration consists of two new services:

1. **CrewAI Service** (ports 9004/9005)
   - Multi-agent orchestration with specialized "crews"
   - PubSub integration for asynchronous messaging
   - Prometheus metrics for monitoring
   - REST API for crew management
   - Three specialized crew types:
     - Research crew for information gathering and analysis
     - Code Review crew for pull request analysis
     - Data Analysis crew for data processing and insights

2. **n8n Workflow Automation** (ports 5500/5679)
   - Visual workflow builder and automation
   - Integration with external services (GitHub, Slack)
   - Scheduled and event-triggered workflows
   - Example workflows:
     - PR Triage for automated code review
     - Daily Metrics for platform monitoring

## Architecture Integration

The new services connect with the existing Alfred Agent Platform architecture:

### Core Infrastructure Integration
- **PubSub Emulator**: Used for asynchronous messaging between services
- **PostgreSQL/Supabase**: Persistent storage for workflows and task history
- **Redis**: Caching and rate limiting
- **Qdrant**: Vector storage (via RAG Gateway)

### Service Integration
- **RAG Gateway**: Knowledge access for CrewAI agents
- **Agent Core**: Platform API access for workflows
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for metrics collection and visualization

### Workflow Integration
- GitHub PR events trigger code reviews
- Daily metrics collection from all platform services
- Results published to Slack for notifications

## Technical Implementation

### CrewAI Service Structure
- **Base Crew Class**: Foundation for all crew implementations
- **Specialized Crews**: Purpose-built agent teams
- **FastAPI Application**: REST API with background tasks
- **PubSub Integration**: Asynchronous messaging
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Performance monitoring

### n8n Implementation
- **Visual Workflows**: JSON-defined workflow templates
- **External Triggers**: Webhooks and schedules
- **HTTP Integration**: Connects with CrewAI and other services
- **Persistence**: PostgreSQL storage for workflows

## Identified Issues and Gaps

### Security Concerns
1. **Hardcoded Credentials**:
   - Default n8n login credentials in Docker Compose
   - Hardcoded API keys for service authentication
   - Insufficient secrets management

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - CORS policy too permissive (allows all origins)
   - Missing proper authentication for some API endpoints
   - No JWT validation for service-to-service communication

3. **Encrypted Communication**:
   - No TLS/SSL configuration for service-to-service communication
   - Plain HTTP used for all internal endpoints

### Tenant Isolation Issues
1. **Incomplete Multi-Tenant Support**:
   - CrewAI service tracks tenant_id but lacks proper database isolation
   - n8n workflows don't have tenant-specific configurations
   - Missing tenant-based rate limiting
   - No tenant-specific credentials or API keys

2. **Resource Separation**:
   - Shared database for all tenants without proper schema separation
   - No resource quotas or limits per tenant
   - No tenant-specific logging or auditing

### Platform Integration Gaps
1. **UI Integration**:
   - Missing CrewAI dashboard in Mission Control
   - No workflow management interface for n8n in platform UI
   - Limited visibility into crew task status

2. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Inconsistent metrics collection across new services
   - Limited logging configuration
   - No centralized log collection
   - Missing alerts for errors or performance issues

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Incomplete error recovery mechanisms
   - No systematic approach to failed PubSub messages
   - Missing dead letter queues
   - Limited retry logic for failed operations

## Recommended Improvements

### Short-Term Fixes (High Priority)

1. **Security Enhancements**
   ```yaml
   # In docker-compose.crewai-n8n.yml
   environment:
     # Replace hardcoded values with environment variables
     - ALFRED_RAG_API_KEY=${ALFRED_RAG_API_KEY:-crew-key}
     - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=${N8N_USER:-admin}
     - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=${N8N_PASSWORD:-alfred123}
   ```

   ```

3. **Resource Limits**
   - Add resource constraints to prevent service overload:
   ```yaml
   deploy:
     resources:
       limits:
         cpus: '1.0'
         memory: 1G
       reservations:
         cpus: '0.25'
         memory: 512M
   ```

4. **Monitoring Integration**
   - Update Prometheus configuration to scrape metrics from new services:
   ```yaml
   # Add to monitoring/prometheus/prometheus.yml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'crewai'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['crewai-service:9005']

   ```sql
   -- Tasks table to track crew tasks
   CREATE TABLE crew_tasks (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     crew_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     tenant_id UUID REFERENCES tenants(id),
     status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
     content JSONB NOT NULL,
     created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
     completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
     result JSONB
   );

   -- RLS policies for tenant isolation
   ALTER TABLE crew_tasks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation_crew_tasks ON crew_tasks
     USING (tenant_id = auth.uid() OR tenant_id IS NULL);
   ```

2. **n8n Schema Isolation**
   ```sql
   -- Create schema for n8n
   CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS n8n;

   -- Grant permissions to n8n schema
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA n8n TO ${DB_USER};
   GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA n8n TO ${DB_USER};
   GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA n8n TO ${DB_USER};
   ```

### Environment Variables

Add these environment variables to properly configure the services:

```bash
# CrewAI Configuration
ALFRED_RAG_API_KEY=secure-crew-api-key
CREWAI_PORT=9004
CREWAI_METRICS_PORT=9005
CREWAI_LOG_LEVEL=INFO
CREWAI_TENANT_SCHEMA=crew_data

# n8n Configuration
N8N_USER=secure-username
N8N_PASSWORD=secure-complex-password
N8N_DB_SCHEMA=n8n
N8N_METRICS=true
N8N_METRICS_PORT=5679
```
