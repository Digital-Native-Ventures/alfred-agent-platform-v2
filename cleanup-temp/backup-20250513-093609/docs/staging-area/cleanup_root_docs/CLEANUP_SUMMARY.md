# Alfred Agent Platform v2 - Environment Cleanup Summary

## Cleanup Actions Performed

This document summarizes the cleanup actions performed on the project to consolidate environment configurations and remove redundant files.

### Date: May 12, 2025

### Files Backed Up

All removed files were backed up to `./cleanup_backup_20250512/` before removal.

### Docker Compose Files

The Docker Compose configuration has been consolidated:

- **Current Configuration**:
  - `docker-compose-clean.yml` - Base configuration file
  - `docker-compose-optimized.yml` - Optimized version
  - `docker-compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment specific config
  - `docker-compose/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment specific config

- **Removed Files**:
  - 30+ individual Docker Compose files in the root directory that were replaced by the consolidated approach

### Startup Scripts

The platform startup has been consolidated:

- **Current Configuration**:
  - `start-platform.sh` - Unified startup script with support for multiple environments and components
  - `check-env-vars.sh` - Environment variable validation script

- **Removed Files**:
  - `start-alfred.sh` - Legacy startup script
  - `start-clean.sh` - Legacy startup script
  - `start-production.sh` - Legacy startup script
  - `start-llm-integration.sh` - LLM-specific startup script
  - `start-llm-with-keys.sh` - LLM-specific startup script with key management

### Infrastructure/Fix Scripts

Multiple one-off fix scripts have been backed up:

- 35+ fix and update scripts that were used for one-time fixes or updates to specific services

## Current Environment Structure

After cleanup, the platform environment structure is as follows:

1. **Base Configuration**:
   - `docker-compose-clean.yml` defines all services with standard settings

2. **Environment-specific Overrides**:
   - `docker-compose/docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment settings
   - `docker-compose/docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production environment settings

3. **Startup Script**:
   - `start-platform.sh` provides a unified interface for managing the platform:
     ```bash
     # Start all services in development mode
     ./start-platform.sh

     # Start in production mode
     ./start-platform.sh -e prod

     # Stop all services
     ./start-platform.sh -a down

     # Show logs for specific service
     ./start-platform.sh -a logs redis
     ```

## How to Work with the Current Environment

1. Use `start-platform.sh` with appropriate flags to manage services
2. Environment variables are stored in `.env` file
3. For development, use the default `-e dev` option (or omit the flag)
4. For production, use `-e prod` option

## If Needed: Restoring Backed Up Files

If you need any of the backed up files, they can be found in the `./cleanup_backup_20250512/` directory.
