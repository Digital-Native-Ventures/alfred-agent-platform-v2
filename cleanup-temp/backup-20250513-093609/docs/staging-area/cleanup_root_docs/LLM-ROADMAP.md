# Alfred LLM Integration: Current State and Roadmap

## Current Implementation Status

### What Works
- ✅ **Local Models via Ollama**
  - Direct connection to Ollama for TinyLlama and Llama2 models
  - Reliable responses through multiple endpoint fallbacks
  - Simple CLI tools for testing and interaction

- ✅ **Model Registry**
  - Registration of both local and cloud models
  - Storage of model metadata and capabilities
  - API for listing and querying available models

- ✅ **Streamlit UI Integration**
  - Model selection by provider and model type
  - Debug mode for tracing requests and responses
  - Direct Ollama access for reliable responses

### Current Limitations
- ❌ **Model Router Issues**
  - Expects numeric IDs but UI sends string model names
  - Missing endpoint configurations for many models
  - No proper error handling or fallback chains
  - Limited model selection intelligence for "Auto" option

- ❌ **Cloud API Integration**
  - API keys not properly distributed to services
  - No validation of API keys before attempting requests
  - Missing proper error handling for API failures

## AI Switchboard Roadmap

### Phase 1: Stabilization (Immediate)
1. **Document Current Implementation**
   - ✅ Create LLM-SETUP.md with setup instructions
   - ✅ Add integration steps to CLAUDE.md
   - ✅ Document direct Ollama access implementation

2. **Fix Basic Model Router Issues**
   - [ ] Update router to accept both numeric IDs and string names
   - [ ] Add endpoint configurations to all registered models
   - [ ] Implement basic error handling with informative messages

3. **Improve API Key Management**
   - [ ] Enhance .env.llm to separate API keys by provider
   - [ ] Add validation of API keys at startup
   - [ ] Create secure key distribution to relevant services

### Phase 2: Enhanced Routing (Near-term)
1. **Implement Basic Model Selection Logic**
   - [ ] Create rules for content type detection (text, code, etc.)
   - [ ] Add basic routing based on content complexity
   - [ ] Implement routing based on available resources

2. **Add Fallback Chains**
   - [ ] Create configurable fallback sequences
   - [ ] Implement graceful degradation to local models
   - [ ] Add retry logic with different models on failure

3. **Expand Model Support**
   - [ ] Add support for additional Ollama models
   - [ ] Integrate with more cloud providers
   - [ ] Support specialized models for specific tasks

### Phase 3: True AI Switchboard (Long-term)
1. **Content-Aware Routing**
   - [ ] Develop ML-based content classification
   - [ ] Create intelligent model selection based on query intent
   - [ ] Add learning capabilities to improve routing over time

2. **Multi-Model Orchestration**
   - [ ] Enable parallel queries to multiple models
   - [ ] Implement response merging and consensus mechanisms
   - [ ] Add cascading workflows for complex queries

3. **Resource Optimization**
   - [ ] Add cost-aware routing decisions
   - [ ] Implement performance monitoring and optimization
   - [ ] Create dynamic scaling based on usage patterns

## Technical Debt to Address
1. **Router Implementation**
   - Fix string vs. numeric ID issue in model router
   - Add proper validation of model preferences
   - Implement consistent error handling

2. **Model Registry Schema**
   - Update model schema to include all necessary endpoint data
   - Add validation for required fields
   - Implement version tracking for models

3. **API Integration**
   - Create proper abstractions for different providers
   - Add authentication handling for each provider
   - Implement rate limiting and quota management

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Create a pull request with the current direct Ollama access implementation
2. Update the model router to properly handle string model names
3. Add proper endpoint configurations to the model registry
4. Implement basic "Auto" selection logic based on simple rules
5. Add proper error handling with informative messages
