## Low-Hanging Fruit Details

### OPT-001: Container Resource Limits

**Description**: Add memory and CPU limits to containers in docker-compose.yml based on observed usage patterns.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Measure baseline resource usage of each container
2. Add appropriate limits with 30% headroom
3. Test under load to ensure limits aren't too restrictive

**Example**:
```yaml
agent-rag:
  # ... existing config
  deploy:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 700M
        cpus: '0.5'
      reservations:
        memory: 400M
        cpus: '0.1'
```

**Risk Assessment**: Low - Service restarts may occur if limits are too aggressive, but won't affect overall system stability.

### OPT-002: Standardize Health Checks

**Description**: Implement consistent health check patterns across all services with proper readiness/liveness separation.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create a health check template with standard endpoints:
   - `/health/live` - Minimal check that service is running
   - `/health/ready` - Check that service is ready to accept traffic
   - `/health/metrics` - Prometheus metrics endpoint
2. Update Docker health check configuration with appropriate intervals

**Example**:
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "-q", "--spider", "http://localhost:8000/health/live"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 20s
```

**Risk Assessment**: Low - Health checks are non-invasive and don't affect core functionality.

### OPT-003: Implement Retry Logic

**Description**: Add retry mechanisms for critical service interactions to increase resilience.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Identify critical service-to-service interactions
2. Implement exponential backoff retry logic
3. Add circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures

**Example Python Code**:
```python
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(5), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=1, max=10))
async def call_model_registry(query):
    # Existing code
```

**Risk Assessment**: Low - Can be implemented without changing core logic.

### OPT-004: Startup Sequence Order

**Description**: Improve container startup sequence by adding proper dependency conditions.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Map dependencies between services
2. Update `depends_on` conditions with health checks
3. Add startup delay where needed

**Example**:
```yaml
agent-financial:
  # ... existing config
  depends_on:
    db-postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
    redis:
      condition: service_healthy
    model-router:
      condition: service_started
```

**Risk Assessment**: Low - Improves stability without changing runtime behavior.

### OPT-005: Environment Variable Cleanup

**Description**: Consolidate and standardize environment variables across services.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Audit all environment variables in docker-compose.yml
2. Create a standardized .env template
3. Remove redundant variables
4. Document all variables with descriptions

**Example**:
```
# .env.example
# Database Configuration
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=secure-password-here
DB_NAME=alfred_db

# Service URLs (for internal communication)
MODEL_ROUTER_URL=http://model-router:8080
RAG_GATEWAY_URL=http://agent-rag:8501
```

**Risk Assessment**: Low - Documentation improvement with minor configuration changes.
