# Alfred Agent Platform v2 - Refactoring Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Foundation and Analysis
- ✅ Created detailed service inventory
- ✅ Analyzed existing startup configurations
- ✅ Developed service naming convention
- ✅ Created dependency graph
- ✅ Designed unified Docker Compose structure
- ✅ Designed alfred script interface
- ✅ Created implementation and testing plans

### Phase 2: Implementation
- ✅ Created base `docker-compose.yml` with all services
- ✅ Created environment-specific overrides (`docker-compose.dev.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`)
- ✅ Created component-specific overrides (`docker-compose.core.yml`, `docker-compose.agents.yml`, etc.)
- ✅ Created unified `alfred.sh` script
- ✅ Defined standard environment variables in `.env.example`
- ✅ Created testing framework
- ✅ Created installation script
- ✅ Created sample service implementations for testing

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- ✅ Fixed health check issues in Docker Compose files
- ✅ Updated service health test script
- ✅ Created validation script for core services
- ✅ Added missing environment variables
- ✅ Created database migrations for testing
- ✅ Successfully started core infrastructure services

## Current Status
- The base configuration has been implemented with all services defined
- Component-specific and environment-specific configurations are working
- The unified management script (`alfred.sh`) is operational
- Core infrastructure services (Redis, PostgreSQL) are running successfully
- Environment variables have been standardized and documented
- Sample service implementations are in place for testing

## Next Steps
1. **Further Implementation Testing**
   - Test agent services with their sample implementations
   - Test UI services
   - Test monitoring services

2. **Documentation Completion**
   - Finalize service implementation guide
   - Complete migration guide for existing users
   - Create examples and usage documentation

3. **Production Testing**
   - Test with production-specific settings
   - Validate scaling and performance
   - Test security configurations

## Issues and Solutions
- **Issue**: Services required Docker file path adjustments
  - **Solution**: Updated paths in development overrides

- **Issue**: Health check configurations had inconsistencies
  - **Solution**: Standardized health check formats across services

- **Issue**: Environment variables naming was inconsistent
  - **Solution**: Created standardized variable names with ALFRED_ prefix

- **Issue**: UI services required more configuration for development
  - **Solution**: Added more specific development settings in `docker-compose.dev.yml`
