# Memory Architecture

*Last Updated: May 13, 2025*  
*Status: Planning Phase*  
*Owner: Memory Architecture Team*

## Overview

The Memory Architecture is a core component of the Alfred Agent Platform, enabling agents to maintain context across conversations, recall relevant historical information, and provide personalized experiences to users.

The full detailed architecture document is available at: [ALFRED_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md](/ALFRED_MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Next Action |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Core Design | Completed | N/A |
| Database Schema | Planning | Create migration scripts |
| Memory Interface | Planning | Implement core classes |
| Agent Integration | Not Started | Extend BaseAgent |
| UI Integration | Not Started | Update Streamlit UI |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Schema and Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Create PostgreSQL memory schema and tables
- [ ] Configure Redis for session storage
- [ ] Set up Qdrant collection for conversation memory
- [ ] Implement Memory interface

### Phase 2: Memory Service (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Build Memory service microservice
- [ ] Create API endpoints for memory operations
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Create unit and integration tests

### Phase 3: Agent Integration (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Extend BaseAgent with memory capabilities
- [ ] Update agent implementations to use memory
- [ ] Add context enhancement in task processing
- [ ] Integration testing with agents

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Implement conversation summarization
- [ ] Build embedding generation pipeline
- [ ] Create memory consolidation service
- [ ] Develop analytics dashboard
