## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Blog Content Creation

Generate complete SEO-optimized blog posts based on topic outlines and keywords.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
{
  "content_type": "blog_post",
  "topic": "Sustainable Home Gardening",
  "keywords": ["organic gardening", "sustainable practices", "home garden"],
  "target_audience": "Homeowners, 30-45 years old",
  "tone": "Informative but friendly",
  "word_count": 1200,
  "sections": ["Introduction", "Benefits", "Getting Started", "Sustainable Practices", "Conclusion"]
}

Output: 
{
  "title": "10 Sustainable Practices for Your Home Garden That Save Time and Money",
  "meta_description": "Learn how organic gardening and sustainable practices can transform your home garden while saving resources. Perfect for busy homeowners.",
  "content": "# 10 Sustainable Practices for Your Home Garden...",
  "word_count": 1230,
  "seo_score": 87,
  "readability_score": "Grade 8"
}
```

### Use Case 2: Social Media Content Calendar

Generate multiple platform-specific social media posts based on content themes.

**Example:**
```
Input:
{
  "content_type": "social_media_batch",
  "platforms": ["Instagram", "Twitter", "LinkedIn"],
  "theme": "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare",
  "posts_per_platform": 5,
  "tone": "Professional with accessible explanations",
  "include_hashtags": true
}

Output:
{
  "twitter": [
    {
      "content": "AI is revolutionizing early disease detection with 94% accuracy in recent studies. Learn how this technology could save millions of lives: [LINK] #AIinHealthcare #MedicalInnovation",
      "optimal_posting_time": "Tuesday 2pm EST"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "instagram": [...],
  "linkedin": [...]
}
```
