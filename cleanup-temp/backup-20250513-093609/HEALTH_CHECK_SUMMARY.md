# Health Check Improvement Summary

## Overview

We've improved the Docker Compose health check configuration across the platform, focusing on:

1. More lenient timeouts and retries
2. Standardized endpoints
3. Fixed incorrect URL patterns

## Current Status

The platform's services show a mix of working functionality despite health check failures:

| Service Type | Health Status | Actual Status | Issue |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-------|
| Core Infrastructure | Mostly Healthy | Functional | Redis, PubSub working; Vector DB missing curl |
| LLM Services | Mixed | Partially Functional | Model Registry working; Model Router working; LLM service started but empty model list |
| Database Services | Mixed | Functional | Postgres working and accepting connections; API missing shell/wget |
| Agent Services | Unhealthy | Mixed | Agent Core and RAG unresponsive to API calls; health checks failing due to missing wget |
| UI Services | Unhealthy | Unknown | Missing wget for health checks |
| Monitoring | Mostly Healthy | Functional | Node and DB exporters working |

**Test Results:**
- Redis: Responding to ping commands ✅
- PostgreSQL: Accepting connections ✅
- LLM Service: API accessible but no models loaded ✅
- Model Router: Health endpoint accessible and reports healthy ✅
- Agent Core: Connection reset when accessing health endpoint ❌
- RAG Service: Connection reset when accessing health endpoint ❌

## Immediate Fixes

The following changes have been made:

1. **Health Check Parameters**: Increased across the board
   - interval: 30s (previously 10s)
   - timeout: 20s (previously 5s)
   - retries: 5 (previously 3)
   - start_period: 45s (previously 30s)

2. **Endpoint Standardization**: Fixed URL patterns
   - Replaced localhost:localhost with localhost
   - Standardized on /health endpoints
   - Fixed doubled paths like /healthzhealth

3. **Credentials**: Created consistent credentials file location
   - Now located at config/credentials/empty-credentials.json
   - Updated all container volume mounts

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Temporarily Disable or Simplify Health Checks**:
   Edit `docker-compose-clean.yml` to use basic process checks instead of HTTP checks:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "true"]  # Always pass health check (dev only!)
     # OR
     test: ["CMD-SHELL", "test -f /proc/1/status || exit 1"]  # Basic process check
   ```

2. **Fix Core Service Issues**:
   - Focus on resolving Agent Core and RAG service connection issues
   - Check container logs with `docker logs agent-core` and `docker logs agent-rag`
   - Consider rebuilding these services with `docker-compose build agent-core agent-rag`

### Long-Term Recommendations

1. **Add missing tools** to container images:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y wget curl netcat-openbsd
   ```

2. **Standardize health check approach** across all services:
   - Implement both a `/health` endpoint that returns simple status
   - Consider a deeper `/healthz/ready` endpoint for readiness checks

3. **Create a health check proxy** container dedicated to checking service health

4. **Implement tiered health checks**:
   - Basic: Process existence check (`test -f /proc/1/status`)
   - Standard: HTTP endpoint check (`wget -q -O - http://localhost:{port}/health`)
   - Deep: Functional verification (DB connections, dependent services)

## Test Results

We've conducted the following tests after applying our health check changes:

| Service Type | Health Check Status | Actual Functionality |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Core Infrastructure | Mixed | Redis, PostgreSQL working; Vector DB showing unhealthy but likely working |
| LLM Services | Mixed | Model Registry healthy; Model Router endpoint responding; LLM service API working |
| Database Services | Mixed | Postgres working; Other DB services showing unhealthy |
| Agent Services | All unhealthy | Agent Core and RAG services not responding to API calls |
| UI Services | All unhealthy | Not tested directly |
| Monitoring | Mixed | Node and DB exporters healthy; Others showing no health check |

**Key Findings:**
1. Health checks are still showing as unhealthy for many containers due to missing tools
2. Despite unhealthy status, some services (Model Router, LLM service) are actually working
3. Agent services (Core, RAG) are not responding to API calls
4. More troubleshooting is needed to get all services fully functional

## Next Steps

1. Review the detailed [HEALTH_CHECK_IMPROVEMENTS.md](./HEALTH_CHECK_IMPROVEMENTS.md) document
2. Update Dockerfiles to include necessary health check tools
3. Consider implementing a dedicated health check system
4. Troubleshoot agent services (agent-core, agent-rag) to diagnose connectivity issues

## Conclusion

Key infrastructure and LLM services are functional despite health check failures. However, agent services
are still unresponsive and require further investigation. For development purposes,
the platform is partially functional. For production, addressing both the missing health check tools
and agent service connectivity issues should be prioritized to ensure proper functionality, monitoring,
and auto-recovery.
