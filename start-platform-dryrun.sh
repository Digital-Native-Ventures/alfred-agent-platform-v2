${BOLD}[DRY RUN] How to Use the Start Platform Script${NORM}

${BOLD}Basic Usage${NORM}

./start-platform.sh [options] [services]

${BOLD}Common Commands${NORM}

1. Start all services in development mode:
./start-platform.sh
2. Start all services in production mode:
./start-platform.sh -e prod
3. Start specific services only:
./start-platform.sh agent-core ui-chat
4. Stop all services:
./start-platform.sh -a down
5. Stop and remove volumes (cleanup):
./start-platform.sh -a down -c
6. View logs for all services:
./start-platform.sh -a logs
7. View logs for specific services:
./start-platform.sh -a logs agent-core
8. Restart services:
./start-platform.sh -a restart
9. Run in detached mode (background):
./start-platform.sh -d

${BOLD}Options${NORM}

- e, --env ENV - Environment to use (dev, prod, local, test)
- a, --action ACTION - Action to perform (up, down, restart, logs)
- c, --clean - Clean volumes when performing down action
- d, --detach - Run containers in detached mode
- h, --help - Show help message

${BOLD}For More Information${NORM}

Run the help command:
./start-platform.sh --help
