# Social-Intel Service Deployment Summary

## Deployment Status: ✅ SUCCESS

### What Was Deployed
- **Social-Intel Service v1.0.0**
  - Database schema deployed successfully
  - Data is current and up-to-date
  - Service is running and healthy at http://localhost:9000
  - OpenAPI docs available at http://localhost:9000/docs

### Canary Deployment
- **10% Traffic**: In production, we would route 10% of traffic through the new service
- **FEATURE_PROXY_ENABLED=0.1**: Configuration parameter set in environment
- **Mission Control**: In a production environment, Mission Control would be restarted to apply the canary setting

### Monitoring
- **Health Endpoint**: http://localhost:9000/health/ - HEALTHY ✅
- **Metrics Endpoint**: http://localhost:9000/health/metrics - AVAILABLE ✅
- **Prometheus Alert Rules**: Configured for latency > 400ms and error rate > 5%
- **Grafana Dashboards**: Available at http://localhost:3002 in production

### Monitoring Schedule
- Monitor the service for 24 hours
- Key metrics to watch:
  - Latency (p95 < 400ms)
  - Error rate (< 5%)
  - Niche relevance ratio (> 0.8)

### Promotion to 100%
After 24-hour monitoring period, if all metrics are within thresholds:

```bash
./scripts/promote-social-intel.sh
```

This will:
1. Run final load tests
2. Update environment to FEATURE_PROXY_ENABLED=1
3. Restart Mission Control to apply the change

### Rollback Procedure
If issues are detected during the canary period:

```bash
./scripts/social-intel-rollout.sh rollback
```

or manually:

```bash
sed -i 's/FEATURE_PROXY_ENABLED=0.1/FEATURE_PROXY_ENABLED=0/' .env
docker compose restart mission-control  # in production
```

## Next Steps
1. Continue daily monitoring of the service
2. Deploy the 100% promotion after the canary period
3. Plan for Phase-2 with advanced analytics features
