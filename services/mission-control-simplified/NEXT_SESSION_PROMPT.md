# Next Session Prompt

## Task Description
You are continuing work on the integration between Mission Control Simplified and the Social Intelligence Agent, specifically addressing the Niche-Scout workflow integration. In the previous session, we identified and documented an issue where the Social Intelligence Agent API returns irrelevant results (e.g., "Financial Literacy Shorts") when searching for specific niches (e.g., "mobile" in "Gaming"). We developed a comprehensive integration plan and documentation to address this issue.

## Current Status
We have:
1. Identified the root cause: The Social Intelligence API ignores search parameters
2. Implemented a basic client-side transformation as a temporary fix
3. Developed a detailed integration plan with multi-phase approach
4. Created comprehensive documentation including implementation guide and API specs
5. Planned a step-by-step approach to implement the solution

## Next Steps
Your task is to begin implementing Phase 0 (Enhanced Client-side Transform) of the integration plan. This involves:

1. Enhancing the string similarity function
2. Improving niche generation for better relevance to search queries
3. Adding metrics collection for performance monitoring
4. Updating the UI to properly display transformed data

## Key Documents to Review
Before starting implementation, please review these documents:

1. `/docs/Niche-Scout_Social-Intel_Integration_Gap_Plan.md` - The master plan outlining the approach
2. `/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed implementation instructions
3. `/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Current and future API specifications
4. `/integrate-with-social-intel.js` - Current integration code with basic transformation
5. `/public/niche-scout.html` - UI code for displaying niche results
6. `/test-youtube-api.js` - Test script for API validation

## Implementation Details
Focus on implementing the enhanced client-side transformation as described in Section 3 of the Implementation Guide. Key components include:

1. Adding a string similarity function based on Levenshtein distance
2. Enhancing the `getMockNichesForCategory` function to use similarity matching
3. Implementing the `logTransformationMetrics` function for performance tracking
4. Updating the `callNicheScout` function to use the enhanced transformation
5. Adding debug displays to the UI

## Tests to Perform
After implementation, test the solution with:
1. Various search queries in different categories
2. Edge cases (empty queries, uncommon categories)
3. Performance testing to ensure transformation speed is acceptable

## Success Criteria
The implementation will be considered successful if:
1. Searching for "mobile" in "Gaming" returns at least 5 gaming-related niches
2. Transformation time is less than 100ms on average
3. UI correctly displays the transformed data
4. Console logs show relevant metrics for QA analysis

## Additional Notes
- All code should follow existing patterns and naming conventions
- Add detailed comments to explain the transformation logic
- Include console logging for debugging but keep it clean for production
- Document any limitations or edge cases discovered during implementation

Please proceed with implementing Phase 0 of the integration plan, starting with the enhanced string similarity function. Once complete, we will evaluate the results before proceeding to Phase 1.
