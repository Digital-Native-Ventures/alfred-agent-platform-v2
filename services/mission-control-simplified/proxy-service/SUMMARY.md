# Monitoring & Alert Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of monitoring dashboards, alert verification, and rollout management for the Niche-Scout Proxy Service.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Grafana Dashboard Implementation
- Created Grafana provisioning structure with datasource and dashboard configuration
- Created two main dashboards:
  - **Niche-Scout Overview**: Main operational dashboard with key metrics and trends
  - **Niche-Scout Alerts**: Dashboard for monitoring alert status and thresholds
- Added dashboard documentation and README

### 2. Alertmanager Configuration
- Updated Alertmanager configuration with email settings
- Added environment variable placeholders for sensitive credentials
- Created HTML email template for better-formatted alert notifications
- Configured alert routing with proper grouping and timing

### 3. Alert Testing
- Created test script (`test-alerts.sh`) to simulate alert conditions:
  - High error rate simulation (>5%)
  - High latency simulation (>800ms)
  - Low cache hit ratio simulation (<20%)
  - Alert resolution functionality

### 4. 10% Rollout & Rollback Implementation
- Created comprehensive rollout management script (`rollout-toggle.sh`) with:
  - Canary deployment (10% traffic)
  - Progressive rollout controls
  - Status checking
  - Emergency rollback capability
  - Configuration validation

### 5. Histogram Bucket Tuning
- Updated the Prometheus histogram buckets for better resolution around SLO targets
- Focused on 400ms SLO target with additional buckets:
  - Transform Duration: Added 200ms, 300ms, 400ms buckets
  - API Response Time: Added 200ms, 300ms, 400ms, 750ms buckets

### 6. Cache Invalidation Testing
- Added unit tests for cache invalidation endpoint security
- Verified token-based authentication is working correctly
- Added npm script for running cache tests in isolation

### 7. Documentation
- Created comprehensive monitoring documentation in `MONITORING.md`
- Added dashboard-specific README with screenshots and usage instructions
- Documented SLO targets and alert thresholds
- Provided detailed instructions for rollout/rollback procedures

## How to Use

### Monitoring Dashboards
1. Start the system: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Access Grafana: http://localhost:3000
3. View dashboards:
   - Overview: http://localhost:3000/d/niche-scout-overview
   - Alerts: http://localhost:3000/d/niche-scout-alerts

### Alert Testing
```bash
# Test high error rate alert
./scripts/test-alerts.sh --fire error

# Test high latency alert
./scripts/test-alerts.sh --fire latency

# Test low cache hit ratio alert
./scripts/test-alerts.sh --fire cache

# Resolve all alerts
./scripts/test-alerts.sh --resolve
```

### Rollout Management
```bash
# Check current rollout status
./scripts/rollout-toggle.sh --status

# Start 10% canary rollout
./scripts/rollout-toggle.sh --canary

# Emergency rollback
./scripts/rollout-toggle.sh --rollback
```

### Cache Invalidation Testing
```bash
# Run cache invalidation tests
npm run test:cache
```

## Remaining Work

All critical monitoring tasks have been completed. For further enhancements, consider:

1. Adding service-level logging to Grafana (using Loki)
2. Creating user journey dashboards to track end-to-end performance
3. Setting up anomaly detection for proactive alerts
4. Implementing multi-environment dashboard switching

## Conclusion

The monitoring and alerting system now provides comprehensive visibility into the Niche-Scout proxy service, with appropriate alerting thresholds and rollout management capabilities. The implementation satisfies the requirements for p95/error panels and Alertmanager notification verification, enabling safe 10% canary deployments.
