# Phase 0 Implementation Decisions

This document tracks key design and implementation decisions made during Phase 0 of the Niche-Scout â†” Social-Intel Integration project.

## Decision Journal

### 1. String Similarity Implementation

**Decision Point:** Which string similarity algorithm to implement for niche relevance matching

**Options Considered:**
1. Levenshtein distance (edit distance)
2. Jaro-Winkler similarity
3. Cosine similarity with tokenization
4. Simple substring matching (current implementation)

**Decision:** Implement normalized Levenshtein distance with configurable threshold

**Rationale:**
- Levenshtein provides a good balance of accuracy and computational efficiency
- Normalization provides consistent 0-1 range scores regardless of string length
- Matches the specified 0.55 threshold requirement in the Integration Gap Plan
- Can be implemented without external dependencies
- Substring matching is too simplistic and misses semantic similarities

**Potential Impacts:**
- Future Phases: Algorithm can be extracted to proxy service in Phase 1
- Phase 3 will likely replace this with embedding-based similarity, but Levenshtein serves as a good baseline

### 2. Category-Specific Niche Generation

**Decision Point:** How to organize and generate relevant niches for different categories

**Options Considered:**
1. Single flat list with basic filtering
2. Category-specific lists with dynamic query integration
3. Category + subcategory matrix with fallback options
4. API-based suggestion system (future consideration)

**Decision:** Implement comprehensive category-specific lists with query integration and weighted sorting

**Rationale:**
- Provides more relevant results than the current basic implementation
- Ensures minimum niche count (3-5) even for edge cases
- Allows for category-query hybrid matches (e.g., "Mobile Gaming" for query="mobile", category="Gaming")
- Scalable to add more categories as needed
- Preserves realistic metrics from API response

**Potential Impacts:**
- Phase 1: Structure provides clear transformation rules for proxy service
- Phase 2: Can inform API contract design for native implementation
- Phase 3: Reinforcement learning could optimize which niche templates work best

### 3. Transformation Pipeline Design

**Decision Point:** How to structure the transformation logic for maintainability and future extraction

**Options Considered:**
1. Modify existing callback function with enhanced logic
2. Create a linear transformation pipeline with discrete stages
3. Implement a plugin architecture for extensibility
4. Create a separate transformation module

**Decision:** Implement a linear transformation pipeline with well-defined, extractable functions

**Rationale:**
- Makes extraction to proxy service straightforward in Phase 1
- Clear separation of concerns (similarity calculation, niche generation, metrics)
- Easier to unit test each stage independently
- Provides clear documentation of data flow
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

**Potential Impacts:**
- Phase 1: Functions can be directly ported to proxy service
- Phase 2: Pipeline stages align with API contract separation
- Can be gradually replaced as API implementation improves

### 4. Metrics Collection Approach

**Decision Point:** How to collect and store transformation metrics for analysis

**Options Considered:**
1. Console logging only
2. localStorage persistence
3. Server-side logging
4. External analytics service

**Decision:** Implement localStorage persistence with console logging

**Rationale:**
- Client-side solution aligned with Phase 0 requirements
- No server-side changes needed in this phase
- Provides persistent data across page refreshes
- Allows for manual extraction and analysis
- Includes relevant metrics (relevance score, transformation time, etc.)
- Easier debugging during development

**Potential Impacts:**
- Phase 1: Metrics structure can inform Prometheus metrics design
- Phase 3: Collection method previews user feedback mechanisms

### 5. UI Enhancement Approach

**Decision Point:** How to display transformation metrics in the UI

**Options Considered:**
1. Add a debug panel (visible only in development)
2. Add a metrics tab in results view
3. Inline annotations on transformed results
4. No UI changes, console-only

**Decision:** Implement a collapsible debug panel in development mode

**Rationale:**
- Provides visibility without cluttering the main UI
- Helps with QA and acceptance testing
- Can be easily toggled based on environment
- Groups all metrics in one logical place
- Facilitates comparison across different searches

**Potential Impacts:**
- Future phases can build on this UI pattern for metrics visualization
- Establishes framework for more detailed analytics views in the application
