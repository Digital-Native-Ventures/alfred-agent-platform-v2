# Phase 1 Hardening Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the hardening changes made to the Phase 1 implementation of the Niche-Scout ↔ Social-Intel Integration proxy service.

## High Priority Changes

### 1. API Authentication

- Added `SI_API_KEY` environment variable to securely authenticate with the Social Intelligence API
- Modified API client creation to include the authentication header
- Updated Docker Compose files and environment example

### 2. Redis Graceful Fallback

- Implemented a dual-layer caching system with:
  - Primary Redis storage
  - In-memory fallback cache with 5-minute TTL
- Added error handling to gracefully degrade when Redis is unavailable
- Implemented memory cache stats for monitoring
- Ensured cache writes go to both Redis and memory

### 3. Alerting Rules

- Added Alertmanager to the infrastructure
- Created alert rules based on key metrics:
  - `proxy_error_rate > 0.05` (critical alert)
  - `proxy_p95_latency > 0.8` (warning alert)
  - `proxy_cache_hit_ratio < 0.2` (warning alert)
  - Redis connection failures (critical alert)
  - Service availability (critical alert)
- Configured email notifications with templates
- Added documentation for incident response

## Medium Priority Changes

### 1. Load Testing

- Added k6 load testing script for:
  - Performance validation
  - Cache hit rate validation
  - Error rate validation
- Implemented multi-stage test with ramp-up and cooldown
- Added assertions for p99 latency target (800ms)
- Created cached warmup logic for consistent testing

### 2. Canary Rollout Support

- Added `PROXY_ROLLOUT_PERCENT` environment variable
- Updated Docker Compose with default 10% rollout
- Created UI elements to display current rollout percentage
- Added documentation for gradual rollout from 10% → 30% → 100%

## Low Priority Changes

### 1. Cache-Bust Endpoint

- Added a secure DELETE `/cache/:key?token=TOKEN` endpoint
- Implemented token-based security for cache invalidation
- Added pattern-based cache clearing
- Created metrics for tracking cache operations
- Generated documentation for endpoint usage

## Metrics Enhancements

- **New Metrics:**
  - `proxy_redis_operations` - Counter for Redis operations
  - `proxy_memory_cache_size` - Gauge for memory cache size
  - `proxy_memory_cache_active_items` - Gauge for active memory cache items
  - `proxy_error_rate` - Gauge for error rate calculation
  - `proxy_p95_latency` - Gauge for p95 latency tracking

- **Enhanced Calculations:**
  - Added sliding window for p95 calculation
  - Added error rate based on 1-minute window
  - Improved cache hit ratio calculation
  - Added memory cache stats

## UI Updates

- Added "Powered by Proxy" badge when proxy is used
- Color-coded badge for cache hits (green) vs. proxy processing (blue)
- Added proxy status check to debug panel
- Added display of current rollout percentage
- Updated API response handling to dispatch events for UI updates

## Docker and Infrastructure Updates

- Renamed container to `niche-proxy:latest` for clarity
- Added Alertmanager container and configuration
- Updated Prometheus settings for alert rules
- Added volume for Alertmanager data
- Enhanced Docker Compose for full infrastructure

## Documentation Updates

1. **Hardening Plan** - Comprehensive plan for Phase 1 hardening
2. **UI Updates** - Specific UI changes to integrate proxy indicators
3. **Alerting** - Configuration for Prometheus alerts
4. **Load Testing** - k6 script for performance validation

## Implementation Verification

All high priority items have been implemented:

- ✅ API Authentication
- ✅ Redis Graceful Fallback
- ✅ Alerting Rules

Medium and low priority items are also complete:

- ✅ Load Testing Script
- ✅ Canary Rollout Support
- ✅ Cache-Bust Endpoint

## Next Steps

1. **Run Integration Tests** - Verify implementation with automated tests
2. **Monitor Initial Rollout** - Start with 10% traffic and monitor closely
3. **Grafana Dashboard** - Create comprehensive monitoring dashboard
4. **Runbook** - Develop detailed operational runbook for incidents
