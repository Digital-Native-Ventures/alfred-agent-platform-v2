## Implementation Details

### 1. Containerization

The orchestrator has been containerized using a multi-stage Dockerfile that:
- Builds the application in a Node.js environment
- Creates a minimal production image
- Serves the built assets using a static server

Docker Compose configurations have been created for:
- Standalone development
- Standalone production
- Full stack deployment with all required services

### 2. API Integration

The application has been configured to connect to the Social Intelligence Agent API with:
- Environment variable-based configuration
- Service functions for YouTube workflows
- Mock data fallback for development and testing
- Error handling for service unavailability

### 3. Development Tooling

Development tools and scripts have been added:
- `start-dev.sh` for easy development setup
- `start-prod.sh` for production deployment
- `test-integration.sh` for testing API integration
- CI workflow for GitHub Actions

### 4. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:
- `README.md` with project overview and quick start
- `SETUP.md` with detailed setup instructions
- `NEXT-STEPS.md` with implementation roadmap
- Docker and environment configuration guidance

## Testing Status

The orchestrator has been set up for testing in the following configurations:

1. **Local Development**: Running with `npm run dev`
2. **Containerized Development**: Running with Docker Compose in development mode
3. **Production Deployment**: Running with Docker Compose in production mode
4. **Full Stack**: Running with all required services

All configurations provide appropriate fallback to mock data when services are unavailable.

## Recent Updates

The following improvements have been implemented:

### 1. Enhanced API Integration

- **Service Health Monitoring**: Added service health checks to detect API availability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implemented offline mode for when services are unavailable
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error detection, reporting, and recovery
- **Timeout Management**: Added timeouts for API requests to prevent long waits

### 2. UI Component Enhancements

- **Service Status Indicators**: Added visual indicators for service availability
- **Offline Mode Notifications**: Implemented clear user messaging for offline mode
- **Real-time Health Updates**: Added periodic checking of service health
- **Improved Error Messages**: Enhanced error reporting with specific messages

### 3. Workflow Integration

- **Real API Usage**: Updated components to use actual API services instead of mocks
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Implemented graceful fallback to offline mode when needed
- **Error Recovery**: Added automatic recovery when services become available
- **Result Storage**: Enhanced local storage of workflow results

## Next Steps

The next phase of implementation should focus on:

1. Implementing authentication integration with Supabase
2. Adding more advanced real-time monitoring for workflow status
3. Creating more detailed result visualizations
4. Adding unit and integration tests
5. Implementing performance optimizations for workflow results

## Conclusion

The Alfred Agent Orchestrator has been successfully enhanced with robust service health monitoring, improved error handling, and graceful degradation to offline mode. These improvements ensure a better user experience even when backend services are temporarily unavailable. The implementation provides a solid foundation for further development of the user interface and integration with agent services.
