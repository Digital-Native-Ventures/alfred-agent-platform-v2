# Social Intelligence Agent Workflow Endpoints

This document describes the workflow endpoints implemented in the Social Intelligence service v1.0.0.

## Implementation Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All planned workflow endpoints are now fully implemented and deployed in production with v1.0.0.

## Implemented Endpoints

1. **Workflow Result Retrieval**
   - `GET /workflow-result/{result_id}?type=niche-scout|seed-to-blueprint`
   - Retrieves previously generated workflow results by ID
   - Returns full result data with all metrics and analysis
   - PostgreSQL-backed storage with proper error handling

2. **Workflow History**
   - `GET /workflow-history`
   - Provides history of all workflow executions
   - Includes status, parameters, timestamps, and result links
   - Database-backed for persistence across service restarts

3. **Scheduled Workflows Management**
   - `GET /scheduled-workflows` - Lists all scheduled workflows
   - `POST /schedule-workflow` - Creates new scheduled workflows
   - Full implementation with frequency and parameter validation

4. **Alternative Endpoint Paths**
   - `/youtube/niche-scout` and `/api/youtube/niche-scout`
   - `/youtube/blueprint` and `/api/youtube/blueprint`
   - `/youtube/workflow-result/{id}` and `/api/youtube/workflow-result/{id}`
   - Provides resilience and backward compatibility

## Architecture Implementation

All endpoints are implemented using FastAPI with the following characteristics:
- **Database Persistence**: PostgreSQL for all workflow data
- **Authentication**: API key authentication for security
- **Validation**: Request validation for all inputs
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses with detailed messages
- **Metrics**: Prometheus monitoring for performance tracking
- **Documentation**: Full OpenAPI documentation available at `/docs`

## Example Responses

### Workflow History
```json
[
  {
    "id": "niche-scout-1589567890",
    "workflow_type": "niche-scout",
    "parameters": {"query": "mobile gaming"},
    "status": "completed",
    "started_at": "2025-05-01T12:00:00Z",
    "completed_at": "2025-05-01T12:05:00Z",
    "result_url": "/workflow-result/niche-scout-1589567890?type=niche-scout",
    "user_id": "user-1"
  }
]
```

```

## Testing Coverage

All workflow endpoints have comprehensive test coverage:
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual function behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Testing full endpoint behavior
- **Load Tests**: Performance testing with k6

## Future Enhancements

Planned for future versions:
1. Advanced scheduling options (cron expressions)
2. Workflow templates for common use cases
3. Multi-tenant support for workflow isolation
4. Parameterized workflow chaining
