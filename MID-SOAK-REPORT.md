## Impact of the Fix

The fix has successfully addressed the core issue:
1. **Proper Exception Handling**: Dependency failures are now gracefully handled
2. **Correct Status Codes**: /health returns 503 (not 500) when dependencies are down
3. **Debugging Capability**: DEBUG_MODE provides detailed troubleshooting when needed
4. **No Performance Impact**: The fix adds no measurable latency

## Monitoring Annotation
- **Monitor Until**: 2025-05-17T15:50:09Z
- **Time Remaining**: 12 hours

## Next Steps
1. Continue monitoring for the remaining 12 hours
2. Collect final metrics at T+24h
3. Present soak report to Coordinator for sign-off
4. Prepare for promotion to v0.8.1 GA

## Recommendation
Based on the mid-soak metrics, v0.8.1-rc2 is performing exceptionally well and appears ready for production promotion pending completion of the full 24-hour soak test.
