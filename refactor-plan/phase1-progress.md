# Alfred Agent Platform v2 - Phase 1 Progress

## Work Completed

We have successfully completed the first phase of the refactoring plan, focused on foundation and analysis. The following artifacts have been created:

### Planning Documents
- **Service Inventory**: Comprehensive list of all services and their details
- **Startup Configurations**: Analysis of existing startup methods
- **Dependency Graph**: Visual representation of service dependencies
- **Service Naming Convention**: Standardized naming for consistency
- **Unified Compose Design**: Design for the new Docker Compose structure
- **Alfred Script Design**: Design for the unified command interface
- **Testing & Migration Plan**: Plan for testing and migrating to the new system
- **Implementation Roadmap**: Week-by-week implementation plan

### Implementation Files
- **Base Configuration**: `docker-compose.yml` with all services using standard naming
- **Environment Overrides**: 
  - `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development settings
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production settings
- **Component Overrides**:
  - `docker-compose.core.yml` for core infrastructure services
  - `docker-compose.agents.yml` for agent services
  - `docker-compose.ui.yml` for UI services
  - `docker-compose.monitoring.yml` for monitoring services
- **Command Interface**: `alfred.sh` script for unified management
- **Configuration Example**: `.env.example` with standardized environment variables
- **Documentation**: `README.md` for the new structure

## Next Steps

The next phase of the refactoring plan will focus on:

1. **Testing the New Configuration**
   - Validate service configurations
   - Test service startup and communication
   - Verify component groupings
   - Test the alfred.sh script

2. **Refinement and Optimization**
   - Address any issues found in testing
   - Optimize startup order
   - Enhance error handling
   - Add convenience features

3. **Documentation and Training**
   - Complete user documentation
   - Create migration guide
   - Prepare training materials

## Testing Plan

To test the new configuration, we will:

1. Start with core services only
   ```bash
   cd refactor-unified
   ./alfred.sh start --components=core
   ```

2. Verify core services are running properly
   ```bash
   ./alfred.sh status
   ```

3. Add agent services
   ```bash
   ./alfred.sh start --components=agents
   ```

4. Test integration between core and agent services

5. Add UI and monitoring services
   ```bash
   ./alfred.sh start --components=ui,monitoring
   ```

6. Test complete stack
   ```bash
   ./alfred.sh start
   ```

7. Test production configuration
   ```bash
   ./alfred.sh start --env=prod
   ```

## Risk Assessment

Currently identified risks:

1. **Service Compatibility**: Some services may need additional configuration to work with the new service names
2. **Environment Variables**: The standardized environment variables may need adjustment for some services
3. **Volume Persistence**: Changing volume names may require data migration
4. **Script Logic**: The alfred.sh script may need refinement for edge cases

These risks will be addressed during the testing and refinement phase.
