- [ ] Implement command parsing
- [ ] Implement environment selection
- [ ] Implement component selection
- [ ] Add operations (start, stop, logs, etc.)
- [ ] Add helper functions and documentation

### Day 5: Integration Testing

- [ ] Test script with various command combinations
- [ ] Test all component combinations
- [ ] Test environment combinations
- [ ] Create automated test suite
- [ ] Document initial results

## Week 3: Testing and Refinement

### Day 1-2: Comprehensive Testing

- [ ] Test full stack startup
- [ ] Test individual components
- [ ] Test developer workflows
- [ ] Compare with existing configurations
- [ ] Document any discrepancies or issues

### Day 3-4: Refinement and Optimization

- [ ] Address any issues found in testing
- [ ] Optimize startup order
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Enhance script features
- [ ] Add convenience functions

### Day 5: Documentation and Training Materials

- [ ] Complete user guide
- [ ] Create migration guide
- [ ] Update main README
- [ ] Create examples for common tasks
- [ ] Prepare training materials

## Week 4: Migration and Transition

### Day 1-2: Developer Preview

- [ ] Present new configuration to development team
- [ ] Collect feedback
- [ ] Make necessary adjustments
- [ ] Finalize documentation

### Day 3-4: Controlled Migration

- [ ] Rename old files with .legacy suffix
- [ ] Move new files to primary positions
- [ ] Update CI scripts
- [ ] Update documentation links
- [ ] Provide training sessions

### Day 5: Completion and Review

- Environment-specific configurations
- Successful startup of complete stack

### Milestone 2: Component Configurations and Script Complete (End of Week 2)
- Component-specific configurations
- Working unified script
- Successful testing of all components

### Milestone 3: Testing and Refinement Complete (End of Week 3)
- Comprehensive testing completed
- Issues addressed
- Documentation and training materials complete

### Milestone 4: Migration Complete (End of Week 4)
- All files in place
- Team trained on new system
- Legacy files scheduled for removal

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk: Service compatibility issues
**Mitigation**: Test each service thoroughly, maintain compatibility layer if needed

### Risk: Performance degradation
**Mitigation**: Benchmark before and after, optimize if necessary

### Risk: Team resistance to change
**Mitigation**: Clear documentation, training, highlight benefits

### Risk: Missing critical features
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive inventory, feature testing, user acceptance testing

### Risk: Integration issues with CI/CD
**Mitigation**: Update CI scripts, test in CI environment

## Post-Implementation Tasks

- Monitor usage for 2 weeks
- Collect feedback
- Document lessons learned
- Plan phase 2 improvements
- Remove legacy files after confirmation period
