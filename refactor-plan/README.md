# Alfred Agent Platform v2 - Docker Compose Refactoring Plan

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive refactoring plan for unifying and simplifying the Docker Compose configuration of the Alfred Agent Platform v2. The goal is to create a more maintainable, consistent, and user-friendly stack management system.

## Current Issues

- Multiple overlapping Docker Compose files
- Inconsistent service naming and configuration
- Complex setup processes
- Poor developer experience
- High maintenance burden
- Resource inefficiency

## Refactoring Goals

1. Create a unified, modular Docker Compose structure
2. Implement a consistent naming convention
3. Provide a single command interface
4. Improve documentation
5. Reduce resource usage
6. Simplify onboarding for new developers

## Documents

- **[Service Inventory](service-inventory.md)**: Comprehensive list of all services and their details
- **[Startup Configurations](startup-configurations.md)**: Analysis of existing startup methods
- **[Dependency Graph](dependency-graph.md)**: Visual representation of service dependencies
- **[Unified Compose Design](unified-compose-design.md)**: Design for the new Docker Compose structure
- **[Alfred Script Design](alfred-script-design.md)**: Design for the unified command interface
- **[Testing & Migration Plan](testing-migration-plan.md)**: Plan for testing and migrating to the new system
- **[Implementation Roadmap](implementation-roadmap.md)**: Week-by-week implementation plan

## Implementation Strategy

The refactoring will follow a four-week implementation plan:

1. **Week 1**: Foundation and Analysis
   - Setup and preparation
   - Base configuration design
   - Environment-specific configurations

2. **Week 2**: Component Configurations and Script Development
   - Component-specific configurations
   - Script development
   - Integration testing

3. **Week 3**: Testing and Refinement
   - Comprehensive testing
   - Refinement and optimization
   - Documentation and training materials

4. **Week 4**: Migration and Transition
   - Developer preview
   - Controlled migration
   - Completion and review

## Deliverables

1. New Docker Compose structure:
   - `docker-compose.yml` (base configuration)
   - `docker-compose.dev.yml` (development configuration)
   - `docker-compose.prod.yml` (production configuration)
   - Component-specific configuration files

2. Unified Command Interface:
   - `alfred.sh` script with comprehensive functionality

3. Documentation:
   - Updated README
   - Migration guide
   - User manual
   - Examples

## Getting Started

1. Review the documents in this directory
2. Check the implementation roadmap for the current status
3. Provide feedback on the design
4. Watch for updates during the implementation phase

## Next Steps

The implementation will begin with the creation of the base Docker Compose configuration, followed by the environment and component-specific configurations. The unified script will be developed in parallel, with comprehensive testing throughout the process.

## Team Involvement

The success of this refactoring depends on feedback and involvement from all team members. Please review the plans and provide feedback before the implementation phase begins.
