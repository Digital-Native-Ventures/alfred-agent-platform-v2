# Health Check Implementation Assessment

## Current State

The Alfred Agent Platform v2 has made significant progress in implementing health checks for all services, but several gaps remain compared to our defined standards in `docs/HEALTH_CHECK_STANDARD.md`.

### Compliance Summary

| Service Type | Fully Compliant | Partially Compliant | Non-Compliant | Total |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|-------|
| Core Services | 1 (agent-core) | 1 (db-storage) | 2 (agent-social, db-auth) | 4 |
| UI Services | 0 | 1 (ui-chat) | 0 | 1 |
| Database Metrics | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| Infrastructure | 3 | 0 | 2 | 5 |

### Implementation Analysis

1. **Core Services**:
   - `agent-core`: Fully compliant with `/health`, `/healthz`, and `/metrics` endpoints
   - `db-storage`: Custom implementation with proper `/health` endpoint but missing `/healthz`
   - `agent-social`: Missing standard-compliant health endpoints
   - `db-auth`: Non-standard `/health` implementation, missing `/healthz`

2. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Using dedicated metrics exporters (db-storage-metrics, db-api-metrics, etc.)
   - Metrics exporters themselves implement proper health checks
   - All metrics follow Prometheus format standards

3. **Docker Health Check Configuration**:
   - Inconsistent health check definitions in docker-compose.yml
   - Some services use recommended pattern, others use custom approaches

## Recommendations for Minimal Viable Compliance

Since the platform is in early development, we recommend focusing on these high-priority items:

### 1. Add `/healthz` Endpoint to Custom db-storage Service

```javascript
// Add to migration-bypass.js
app.get('/healthz', (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'application/json');
  res.end(JSON.stringify({ status: 'ok' }));
});
```

### 2. Update agent-social Health Endpoints

The agent-social service should implement the standard endpoints:

```python
@app.get("/health")
async def health_check():
    """Detailed health check endpoint"""
    return {
        "status": "ok",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "services": {}
    }

@app.get("/healthz")
async def simple_health():
    """Simple health check for container probes"""
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

### 3. Standardize Docker Health Check Configuration

Update docker-compose.yml health check definitions for key services:

```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:${PORT}/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 20s
  retries: 5
  start_period: 45s
```

### 4. Update Prometheus Configuration

Ensure all metrics endpoints are properly scraped by updating prometheus.yml:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  # Database Services Metrics
  - job_name: 'db-metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: [
          'db-auth-metrics:9091',
          'db-api-metrics:9091',
          'db-admin-metrics:9091',
          'db-realtime-metrics:9091',
          'db-storage-metrics:9091'
        ]
    metrics_path: '/metrics'
```

## Practical Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Fix critical services (db-storage, agent-social)
2. **Phase 2**: Update Docker health check configurations for all services
3. **Phase 3**: Verify Prometheus scraping configuration
4. **Phase 4**: Document and standardize the approach to health checks

## Long-term Considerations

1. **Health Check Binary**: Consider the tradeoffs between dedicated health check binaries vs. in-service implementation
2. **Metrics Exporters**: The current pattern with separate metrics containers is different from our standard but works well
3. **Standardization**: As the platform matures, consider consolidating around a single approach to health checks

## Conclusion

The platform currently provides basic monitoring capabilities across services, with focused improvements needed in specific areas. For this early stage of development, the priority should be ensuring all services have at least basic health endpoints that allow monitoring systems to track their status.
