# Health Check Implementation - Completion Checklist

Use this checklist to track the remaining tasks needed to complete the health check standardization project.

## UI Admin Service Implementation

- [x] Add health routes to Express application (`/health`, `/healthz`, `/metrics`)
- [x] Configure Docker and metrics export in Dockerfile
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml with metrics port mapping (9091â†’9100)
- [x] Add prometheus.metrics.port label
- [x] Update Prometheus configuration to include UI Admin
- [ ] Test and verify the implementation

## Testing and Validation

- [ ] Start all services with `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Run `scripts/healthcheck/validate-all-healthchecks.sh` to check all endpoints
- [ ] Verify health endpoints return correct format
- [ ] Verify metrics endpoints export Prometheus metrics
- [ ] Check Docker healthcheck status for all services
- [ ] Verify Prometheus scrapes metrics from all services
- [ ] Test dependency tracking between services
- [ ] Test graceful degradation scenarios

## Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Verify Grafana can access Prometheus datasource
- [ ] Import service health dashboard
- [ ] Configure basic alerts for service health
- [ ] Test alerting functionality
- [ ] Create dashboard specific to UI Admin metrics

## Documentation

- [ ] Document UI Admin implementation in HEALTH_CHECK_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- [ ] Update HEALTH_CHECK_OVERVIEW.md with final status
- [ ] Create operational documentation for monitoring
- [ ] Document alerting thresholds and escalation procedures
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common health check issues

## Final Steps

- [ ] Schedule review of health check implementation with team
- [ ] Conduct team training on health check system
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipeline to include health check validation
- [ ] Gather feedback on the implementation
- [ ] Create plan for future enhancements

## Completion Criteria

The health check implementation will be considered complete when:

1. All 8 services have standardized health checks implemented
2. All health endpoints return standardized response format
3. All metrics endpoints export Prometheus-compatible metrics
4. Prometheus successfully scrapes metrics from all services
5. Grafana dashboard shows health status of all services
6. All documentation is completed and up-to-date
7. All tests in the validation script pass
