# Health Check System Assessment

This document provides an assessment of the current health check system implemented across the Alfred Agent Platform v2 services as of May 14, 2025.

## Summary

The platform has implemented a **standardized health check framework** across all services, following the specifications in `docs/HEALTH_CHECK_STANDARD.md`. The implementation uses a consistent approach with:

1. Standardized health check binary (v0.4.0)
2. Uniform health check endpoints
3. Consistent Docker configuration
4. Dependency tracking with circuit breaker patterns

Despite this standardization, several containers are showing as **unhealthy** in the current environment, indicating potential issues with service dependencies or configuration.

## Implementation Status

### Docker Compose Configuration

- **Standard Configuration**: All services use a common health check configuration defined in `docker-compose.yml` under `x-health-check-settings`.
- **Health Check Command**: The standardized `healthcheck` binary is used across services.
- **Timing Parameters**: Consistent parameters are applied:
  - Interval: 30 seconds
  - Timeout: 20 seconds
  - Retries: 5
  - Start period: 45 seconds

### Service Health Endpoint Implementation

Most services have implemented the required standardized health check endpoints:

1. `/health` - Detailed health status
2. `/healthz` - Simple health probe
3. `/metrics` - Prometheus metrics

The implementation is particularly robust in services like:
- `social-intel` - Full implementation with circuit breaker patterns
- `agent-core` - Centralized health module with dependency tracking

### Monitoring Integration

- Health metrics are exported on port 9091 for Prometheus scraping
- Grafana dashboards are available for visualizing service health
- Alerting is configured for unhealthy services

## Current Health Status Issues

Current `docker-compose ps` output shows:

- **1 service healthy**: db-postgres
- **25 services unhealthy**: including agent services, model services, UI services, and monitoring services

This suggests a cascading failure pattern where core infrastructure services are failing, affecting dependent services. The most likely causes are:

1. **Database Connection Issues**: Most agent services require database connections
2. **Network Configuration Problems**: Services unable to reach each other
3. **Environment Variable Misconfiguration**: Missing or incorrect environment variables
4. **Resource Constraints**: Insufficient resources (memory, CPU, disk space)

## Recommended Actions

1. **Investigate Core Infrastructure**:
   - Check database connectivity and schema
   - Verify Redis service is running correctly

2. **Address Dependency Chain**:
   - Start with the most fundamental services (Redis, PostgreSQL)
   - Ensure they are healthy before evaluating dependent services

3. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Run `scripts/validate-env.sh` to verify environment variable configuration
   - Pay special attention to connection strings (DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL)

4. **Check Healthcheck Script Integration**:
   - Ensure `scripts/healthcheck` utilities are functioning correctly
   - Verify Docker health check commands are using the correct endpoints

5. **Fix Service-Specific Issues**:
   - Address any issues with service-specific health checks
   - Verify that all services are implementing the standard pattern

## Conclusion

The health check framework is well-designed and consistently implemented across services. The current unhealthy status of services is likely due to configuration or dependency issues rather than flaws in the health check framework itself.

The dependency chain and proper startup sequence are critical to ensuring overall platform health. Focusing on core infrastructure services first, then progressing up the dependency chain, will help resolve the current health issues.

## Path Forward

1. Restart with core infrastructure services only
2. Verify their health before starting dependent services
3. Follow the dependency chain to bring all services online
4. Use health check data to identify problematic services
5. Address any remaining issues in the health check implementations

By following this approach, the platform can achieve a fully healthy state with proper dependency management through the health check system.
