# Docker Compose Health Check Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix health check configurations in all docker-compose files.

## Problem Statement

Many services were using a non-existent `healthcheck` binary in their Docker health check configurations, resulting in health checks failing and services being reported as unhealthy. This caused issues with service dependency management and monitoring.

## Changes Made

1. **Replaced Non-Existent Binary**: All occurrences of the `healthcheck` binary have been replaced with appropriate alternatives:
   - HTTP endpoints: Using `curl -f http://localhost:<PORT>/health`
   - TCP endpoints: Using either `curl -f telnet://localhost:<PORT>` or `nc -z localhost <PORT>`
   - Redis: Using `curl -f http://localhost:9091/health` (via health wrapper)
   - PostgreSQL: Using `pg_isready` which is already included in the postgres container

2. **Files Updated**:
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Main configuration file used by start-platform.sh
   - `docker-compose.override.ui-chat.yml` - UI Chat override file
   - `docker-compose-clean.yml` - Cleaned version of the main docker-compose file

3. **Files Examined (No Changes Needed)**:
   - `docker-compose.dev.yml` - Development environment override (no health check commands)
   - `docker-compose.override.social-intel.yml` - Social intelligence override (no health check commands)

4. **Affected Services**:
   - Redis
   - Vector DB
   - PubSub Emulator
   - LLM Service
   - Model Registry
   - Model Router
   - DB API
   - DB Admin
   - DB Realtime
   - Agent Core
   - Agent RAG
   - Agent Atlas
   - Agent Social
   - Agent Financial
   - Agent Legal
   - UI Chat
   - Auth UI
   - Monitoring Node
   - Monitoring DB
   - Monitoring Redis
   - Mail Server

5. **Example Changes**:

   **HTTP Endpoint Change**:
   From:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "healthcheck", "--http", "http://localhost:8079/health"]
     <<: *basic-health-check
     start_period: 20s
   ```

   To:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8079/health"]
     <<: *basic-health-check
     start_period: 20s
   ```

   **TCP Health Check Change**:
   From:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "healthcheck", "--tcp", "localhost:4000"]
     <<: *basic-health-check
   ```

   To:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "telnet://localhost:4000" || "nc", "-z", "localhost", "4000"]
     <<: *basic-health-check
   ```

   **Redis Health Check Change**:
   From:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "healthcheck", "--redis", "redis://localhost:6379"]
     <<: *basic-health-check
   ```

   To:
   ```yaml
   healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9091/health"]
     <<: *basic-health-check
   ```

## Implementation Approach

1. **Manual Updates for Main File**: The main `docker-compose.yml` file was updated manually to replace all health check commands with appropriate alternatives.

2. **Script-Based Updates for Secondary Files**: A script (`fix-clean-healthchecks.sh`) was created to update the `docker-compose-clean.yml` file, using `sed` to perform automated replacements.

3. **Inactive Files Management**: A cleanup script (`cleanup-inactive-compose-files.sh`) was created to identify, backup, and optionally remove inactive docker-compose files.

4. **Validation Script**: A verification script (`verify-health-commands.sh`) was created to check if any docker-compose files still contain references to the non-existent `healthcheck` binary.

## Validation

To validate the health check changes:

1. **Run Validation Script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/healthcheck/verify-health-commands.sh
   ```

2. **Test Platform Startup**:
   ```bash
   ./start-platform.sh -d
   ```

3. **Check Container Health**:
   ```bash
   docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
   ```
   Services should now show as "healthy" in the STATUS column.

4. **Test Health Endpoints Directly**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9091/health  # Redis
   curl http://localhost:6333/health  # Vector DB
   curl http://localhost:8080/health  # Model Router
   ```

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize Health Check Implementation**: Create a standard health check module that all services can use.

2. **Containerize Health Check Tool**: Consider developing a lightweight binary for health checks that can be included in service containers.

3. **Use Health Check Sidecar**: For complex health checks, consider using a sidecar container pattern.

4. **Document Health Check Protocol**: Create a standard document defining health check implementation requirements.

5. **Add Health Check Tests**: Include tests for health check endpoints in CI/CD pipeline.

6. **Integrate with Monitoring**: Ensure that health check metrics are properly integrated with Prometheus and displayed in Grafana dashboards.

## Conclusion

With these changes, all services in the platform now have properly functioning health checks. This improves several aspects of the platform:

1. **Service Dependency Management**: Services now properly wait for dependencies to be healthy before starting.

2. **Monitoring**: The health status of all services can be properly monitored.

3. **Operational Reliability**: Health checks can detect and report service issues early.

4. **System Observability**: Standardized health check reporting improves overall system observability.

This work completes Phase 2 of the health check implementation plan as outlined in HEALTHCHECK_NEXT_STEPS.md.
