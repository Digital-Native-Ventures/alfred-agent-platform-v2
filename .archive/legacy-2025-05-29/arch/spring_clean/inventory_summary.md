# Spring-Clean Inventory Summary

## Overview

The Spring-Clean initiative aims to identify and categorize unused components in the codebase to streamline development and maintenance. This document summarizes the results of the initial C-0/C-1 inventory.

## Classification Results

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| USED     | 2020  | 76.7%      |
| ORPHAN   | 613   | 23.3%      |
| **Total** | **2633** | **100%** |

## Key Findings

### Top ORPHAN Categories

1. **Backup Files** (approx. 200 files)
   - Files in backup/ and cleanup-temp/ directories
   - Files with .bak, .backup, .old extensions

2. **Redundant Documentation** (approx. 150 files)
   - Markdown files in the root directory
   - Deployment and status reports
   - Legacy phase documentation

3. **Legacy Configuration** (approx. 100 files)
   - Old docker-compose files
   - Outdated environment configuration
   - Legacy service definitions

4. **Deprecated Scripts** (approx. 80 files)
   - One-off scripts
   - Cleanup scripts
   - Migration scripts from previous phases

5. **Redundant Code** (approx. 80 files)
   - Old implementations with .bak extensions
   - Duplicate service configurations
   - Test legacy code

## Next Steps

1. **Review Classification**: Validate the classification results, particularly for critical components
2. **Refine Categories**: Further classify ORPHAN files into ARCHIVE or REMOVE
3. **Develop Migration Plan**: Create a plan for handling ORPHAN files
4. **Clean-up Strategy**: Implement a strategy for systematic removal or archiving

## Notes

- The classification was performed using automated rules, so some files may be misclassified
- Critical system components have been conservatively marked as USED
- Additional review is recommended before actual removal
- The ORPHAN category only indicates potential candidates for removal or archiving
