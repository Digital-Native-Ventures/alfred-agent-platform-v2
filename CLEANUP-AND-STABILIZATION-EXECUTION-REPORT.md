# Cleanup and Stabilization Execution Report

## Summary

### What We Accomplished

1. **Created Major Cleanup PR (#600)**
   - Proposed archiving 4.2GB of legacy code
   - Introduced anti-sprawl guardrails
   - Reorganized documentation structure
   - **Status**: Closed (partial cleanup already done in PR #599)

2. **Created Baseline Stabilization Issues**
   - #601: Add SBOM & licence scan (cyclonedx + licence-guard)
   - #602: Nightly compose.slim smoke via cron
   - #603: Trivy image scan gate in docker-release.yml
   - #604: Enable Renovate for Python and Docker deps
   - #605: Publish MkDocs site from docs/

3. **Created Next-Layer Improvement Issues**
   - #606: Service Quality: OpenTelemetry Tracing Implementation
   - #607: Resource Governance: CPU/Memory Limits for All Services
   - #608: Epic: Next Layer Improvements (Post-Stabilization)
   - Plus 2 more issues created but not numbered in output

## Current Status

### Repository State
- Partial cleanup completed in PR #599 (moved docs to `docs/cleanup-2025-05/`)
- Root directory reduced from 336 to ~224 files
- Anti-sprawl guardrails ready but not yet merged

### Open Work
- 8 new issues created for systematic improvements
- Focus on security, testing, and operational excellence
- Clear path forward with documented implementation plans

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Security Baseline** (Issue #601)
   - Implement SBOM generation
   - Add license scanning to CI

2. **Container Security** (Issue #603)
   - Add Trivy scanning to docker-release workflow
   - Block releases with HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks)
3. **Continuous Testing** (Issue #602)
   - Create docker-compose.slim.yml
   - Set up nightly smoke tests

4. **Dependency Management** (Issue #604)
   - Enable Renovate bot
   - Configure auto-merge policies

### Medium-term (Next Month)
5. **Documentation Site** (Issue #605)
   - Set up MkDocs
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

6. **Operational Excellence** (Issues #606-608)
   - OpenTelemetry tracing
   - Resource limits
   - Developer velocity improvements

## Key Artifacts Created

1. **Scripts**
   - `scripts/create-baseline-issues.sh` - Creates stabilization issues
   - `scripts/create-next-layer-issues.sh` - Creates improvement issues
   - `scripts/backup-all.sh` - Automated backup for stateful services
   - Various anti-sprawl check scripts

2. **Documentation**
   - `docs/operational/BASELINE-STABILIZATION-PLAN.md`
   - `docs/operational/NEXT-LAYER-IMPROVEMENTS.md`
   - `docs/operational/CLEANUP-STANDARDS.md`

3. **CI/CD Workflows**
   - `.github/workflows/file-hygiene.yml` (in PR #600, not merged)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Coordination is Key**: PR #599 shows multiple people working on cleanup - better coordination needed
2. **Incremental Progress**: Partial cleanup is better than waiting for perfect cleanup
3. **Automation First**: Creating issues systematically ensures nothing is forgotten
4. **Clear Documentation**: Having plans documented makes execution straightforward

## Success Metrics
