# DB Metrics Service HTTP 500 Error Root Cause Analysis

## Issue Description
In version v0.8.1-rc1, the db-metrics services are failing with HTTP 500 errors on the `/health` endpoint. However, the `/healthz` endpoint is still working, which is why Docker shows the containers as healthy in health checks.

## Investigation Process

1. Created a test environment to reproduce the issue
2. Examined the metrics service code and identified potential issues
3. Developed an improved version with better error handling and debugging
4. Validated the fixed version properly handles service dependencies

## Root Cause Identified

The root cause appears to be in the `/health` endpoint implementation, which performs service health checks when called.

Key findings:
1. The service is incorrectly handling HTTP request errors or timeouts when checking dependent services
2. Insufficient error handling allows exceptions in `check_service_http()` to cause 500 errors
3. The `/healthz` endpoint works because it doesn't perform actual health checks, it's a simple static response

## Code Issues

Specific issues identified in the `app.py` file:

1. **Error Handling**: Insufficient exception handling in `check_service_http()` function
2. **Debugging Information**: No debugging options to see detailed error information
3. **Connection Handling**: No proper connection timeout or retry mechanism
4. **Dependency Issues**: The service fails when a dependency is unavailable instead of gracefully reporting the issue

## Solution

The fix involves:

1. Added better exception handling with detailed error logging
2. Implemented a `DEBUG_MODE` environment variable to enable verbose logging
3. Added proper network and connection error handling
4. Ensured errors are properly caught and don't cause the service to return HTTP 500

## Recommendations

1. Update all db-metrics services with the improved error handling
2. Add the `DEBUG_MODE` environment variable set to `true` in staging environments
3. Consider adding connection retries or circuit breakers for dependency failures
4. Update the Dockerfile to use the fixed implementation
5. Implement these changes in a hotfix for v0.8.1-rc1

## Verification

The improved implementation:
1. Successfully handles dependent service availability without causing HTTP 500 errors
2. Provides detailed logs to diagnose issues with dependencies
3. Maintains the expected behavior for health checking

## Implementation Plan

1. Apply the fixed code to all metric services
2. Test in a staging environment
3. Deploy as a hotfix to v0.8.1-rc1
