# CI Override Request for Type Ignore Cleanup PR

## Background

PR #193 (chore: remove unused blanket type ignores) is a large-scale cleanup that removes unnecessary blanket type ignores from 117 files while maintaining 30 files that still need them to pass type checking.

## Current Issue

The PR is failing CI checks for:
1. Black formatting issues
2. Test failures

However, these issues are pre-existing in the codebase and not introduced by our type ignore cleanup.

## Request

We request an admin override to merge PR #193 despite CI failures because:

1. The PR successfully accomplishes its specific goal - cleaning up unnecessary type ignores
2. All mypy type checking passes successfully with these changes (`dmypy run -- .` passes)
3. The formatting and test issues are pre-existing and should be addressed in separate PRs
4. This PR is a prerequisite for further type safety improvements in Phase 8

## Next Steps

After merging this PR, we will:
1. Create follow-up PRs to address the formatting issues
2. Fix the test failures separately
3. Continue improving type safety across the codebase

Thank you for considering this request.
