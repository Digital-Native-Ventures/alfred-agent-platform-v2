- Following naming convention from CLAUDE.md

### 2. Code Formatting

- Applied Prettier formatting to JavaScript files
- Fixed pre-commit configuration issue

### 3. CI/CD Integration
- Added `echo_agent` to CI build matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Added `echo_agent` to deploy workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Created proper service directory structure for echo agent

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Created integration tests: `tests/integration/test_slack_mcp_echo.py`
- Created unit tests: `tests/services/test_slack_mcp_echo.py`
- Tests follow pytest conventions with proper markers

### 5. Helm Configuration

## Current Status

✅ **Local Development**: Working with Docker Compose
✅ **Message Flow**: End-to-end tested with Slack
✅ **CI/CD Alignment**: Follows all conventions
✅ **Testing**: Integration and unit tests in place
✅ **Documentation**: Canary monitoring log created

## Next Steps

1. Build and push echo agent image to GHCR
2. Deploy to Kubernetes staging environment
3. Continue 24-hour canary monitoring
4. Create PR for review and merge

The deployment now perfectly aligns with the existing CI/CD pipeline and development processes.
