# DB Metrics Health Endpoint Fix Implementation

This document outlines the steps taken to fix the HTTP 500 errors in db-metrics services for v0.8.1-rc2.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as insufficient error handling in the `/health` endpoint of the db-metrics service. When a dependent service was unavailable or returned an error, the db-metrics service would fail with HTTP 500 instead of gracefully reporting the dependency as unhealthy.

Key issues:
- Poor exception handling in `check_service_http()`
- No debugging capabilities to diagnose problems
- Insufficient error handling for network and connection errors
- No graceful reporting of dependency failures

## Implementation Steps

1. Created a test environment in `diagnostics/metrics-repro.yml` that reproduces the issue
2. Developed an improved version with better error handling and debugging in `diagnostics/rca/fix_app.py`
3. Added `DEBUG_MODE` environment variable to enable detailed logging
4. Copied the fixed implementation to `services/db-metrics/app.py`
5. Updated Helm chart `values.yaml` to include the DEBUG_MODE configuration
6. Created scripts for testing and deployment
7. Prepared PR template for the fix

## Key Improvements

1. **Better Exception Handling**:
   - Added detailed error handling with traceback logging
   - Ensured all network and connection errors are caught and handled properly

2. **Debugging Capabilities**:
   - Added `DEBUG_MODE` environment variable to toggle verbose logging
   - Implemented detailed error reporting for troubleshooting

3. **Graceful Error Reporting**:
   - Ensured `/health` endpoint reports correct status codes:
     - 200 OK: When service and dependencies are healthy
     - 503 Service Unavailable: When dependencies are unhealthy
     - Never returns 500 Internal Server Error

4. **Improved Testing**:
   - Created automated test scripts to verify proper error handling
   - Implemented synthetic load testing to validate fixes

## Verification

The implementation was verified with:
1. Local testing using mock services to simulate dependency failures
2. Synthetic load testing to ensure no 500 errors are returned
3. Manual verification of response codes from `/health` endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Complete 24-hour soak testing in staging environment
2. Monitor Grafana alerts to ensure no issues
3. Coordinator sign-off for promotion to GA
4. Final deployment of v0.8.1 to production
