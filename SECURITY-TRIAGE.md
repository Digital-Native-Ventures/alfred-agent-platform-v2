# Security Triage - Post-LFS Fix

## Current Status
- GitHub org created: Digital-Native-Ventures
- Repository moved to enable LFS purchases
- Security scans are running but results not uploading due to missing SARIF permissions

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix SARIF Upload Permissions
**File**: `.github/workflows/security-fullscan.yml`

Add after line 3:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write
```

**How to apply**:
1. Go to https://github.com/Digital-Native-Ventures/alfred-agent-platform-v2/blob/main/.github/workflows/security-fullscan.yml
2. Click Edit (✏️)
3. Add the permissions block
4. Create PR with title: "fix: add SARIF upload permissions to security workflow"

### 2. CVE Triage (After SARIF fix)
Once security results upload properly:
1. Check Security tab for CVE findings
2. Create tickets for Critical/High vulnerabilities
3. Focus on fixable vulnerabilities first

### 3. Secret Rotation (After SARIF fix)
Gitleaks findings will show in Security tab after fix:
1. Identify any leaked credentials
2. Rotate/revoke affected secrets
3. Replace with proper secret references

## Next Steps
1. Apply SARIF fix via web UI (avoids LFS issues)
2. Re-run Security Full Scan workflow
3. Review findings in Security tab
4. Create tracking issues for remediation

## LFS Resolution
- Monitor https://github.com/organizations/Digital-Native-Ventures/settings/billing
- Look for "Git LFS Data" section to appear
- Purchase data packs when option becomes available
