# Board Sync - BizDev Epics

Date: Sat May 24 11:58:36 UTC 2025

## Actions Taken

1. Added bizdev-sprint label to the following epic issues:
   - #398: Epic 401: BizDev MVP
   - #399: Epic 402: BizDev MVP
   - #400: Epic 403: BizDev MVP
   - #401: Epic 404: BizDev MVP
   - #402: Epic 405: BizDev MVP

2. Note: The GA v3.0.0 Checklist project board does not have a BizDev Backlog column.
   Available columns are: Todo, In Progress, Done

## Recommendation

Consider adding a BizDev Backlog column to the GA v3.0.0 Checklist project board
or using the existing Todo column with the bizdev-sprint label for filtering.
