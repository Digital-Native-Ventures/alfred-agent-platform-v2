### ❌ Unhealthy Services (2)
1. **monitoring-redis** - Unhealthy
   - Status: Up 7 hours but health check failing
   - Impact: Redis monitoring metrics collection impaired

2. **redis-exporter** - Unhealthy
   - Status: Up 7 hours but health check failing
   - Impact: Redis metrics export to Prometheus impaired

### ℹ️ Services Without Health Checks (3)
- alfred-agent-platform-v2-db-exporter-1
- monitoring-dashboard
- monitoring-metrics

## Health Improvements Achieved

### Initial State
- Health Status: Unknown/Mixed
- Many services without health checks
- No standardized health monitoring

### Current State
- **94.4% Health Rate** (34/36 services)
- Standardized health checks across all critical services
- Prometheus-compatible health endpoints
- Consistent health check intervals and thresholds

## Remaining Issues

### Critical
1. **monitoring-redis** - Health check failing despite service running
   - Likely configuration issue with health endpoint
   - Requires investigation of Redis Sentinel health check

2. **redis-exporter** - Health check failing
   - May be related to monitoring-redis issues
   - Check exporter configuration and Redis connection

### Non-Critical
- 3 services without health checks (monitoring infrastructure)
- These are considered acceptable as they are monitoring tools themselves

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Investigate monitoring-redis health check failure
   - Review redis-exporter configuration
   - Consider if monitoring services need health checks

2. **Future Improvements**
   - Add health check dashboards in Grafana
   - Set up alerts for health check failures
   - Document health check troubleshooting procedures

## Conclusion

The Alfred Agent Platform v2 has achieved a **94.4% health rate** with comprehensive health monitoring across all critical services. Only 2 services remain unhealthy, both related to Redis monitoring infrastructure. The platform is production-ready from a health monitoring perspective.
