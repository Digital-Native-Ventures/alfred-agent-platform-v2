# Slack Redis Authentication Fix

## Root Cause
The Slack bot was failing with "Authentication required" error because the Redis instance requires a password, but the slack-bot service wasn't configured with the Redis password.

## Investigation Process
1. Initial symptoms: Health endpoint returning 503 with "Authentication required"
2. Discovered Redis requires authentication: `NOAUTH Authentication required`
3. Found Redis password in docker-compose environment: `REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD}`
4. Verified password is set: `NTWtO6kBAsuoaKQJMXEqXEE8qxcHNmrc`

## Solution
Updated `docker-compose.yml` to include Redis password in the connection URL:

```yaml
environment:
  - REDIS_URL=redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379
```

## Verification
After applying the fix:
- Health endpoint returns: `{"ok": true, "redis": "healthy", "slack": "healthy", "version": "unknown"}`
- Container status: `healthy`
- Redis connection: Successfully authenticated

## Complete Fix Summary
1. **Redis connection URL**: Changed from `redis://redis:6379` to use container hostname
2. **Redis authentication**: Added password to URL format `redis://:${REDIS_PASSWORD}@redis:6379`
3. **Dockerfile entrypoint**: Fixed to use `bot:app`
4. **Dependencies**: Added `depends_on` for Redis service

The Slack integration is now fully functional with proper Redis authentication.
