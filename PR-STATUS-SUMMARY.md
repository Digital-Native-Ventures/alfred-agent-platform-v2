# PR #55 Status Summary

## Overview
PR #55 implements the Slack MCP Gateway and is currently failing CI checks.

## Current Issues

### 1. Linter Errors (Still Failing)
- Various flake8 errors for unused variables, trailing whitespace
- Not directly related to Slack MCP Gateway implementation
- Would require cleaning up many unrelated files

### 2. Build & GHCR Push (Failing)
- The docker build itself succeeds but pushing to GHCR fails with 403 Forbidden
- This is because the PR workflow doesn't have secrets access for security reasons
- The image `ghcr.io/locotoki/alfred-platform/slack_mcp_gateway` cannot be pushed from PR

### 3. Integration Tests (Failing)
- Can't start because they depend on the built images
- Will fail until build issue is resolved

## What's Working
- Security scan ✅
- Detect changes ✅
- Black formatting check ✅
- Import ordering (isort) ✅

## Completed Fixes
1. Fixed import ordering with isort
2. Removed alfred-core from CI build matrix (obsolete)
3. Added package-lock.json to gitignore exceptions
4. Updated docker-compose.yml with slack_mcp_gateway service

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Merge Despite CI Failures
- The linter errors are not in the slack_mcp_gateway code
- The GHCR push failure is expected for PR workflows
- After merge, the main branch CI will have access to push to GHCR

### Option 2: Fix Linter Issues
- Would require cleaning up ~30+ files with various linter violations
- Most are unrelated to this PR's scope
- Could create a separate PR for linter cleanup

### Option 3: Build Without Push
- Modify CI to skip GHCR push for PRs
- Would allow build verification without authentication issues

## Recommendation
Since the slack_mcp_gateway implementation is complete and the main issues are:
1. Unrelated linter errors in other files
2. Expected GHCR authentication issues for PRs

I recommend **Option 1**: Merge the PR and let the main branch CI handle the GHCR push.

## Slack MCP Gateway Implementation
The implementation is complete with:
- ✅ Socket Mode connection to Slack
- ✅ Redis Streams integration (mcp.requests/mcp.responses)
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ Docker containerization
- ✅ Helm charts for K8s deployment
- ✅ Staging configuration

## Post-Merge Actions
1. CI on main branch will build and push to GHCR
2. Deploy to staging using the deployment guide
3. Monitor for 24-hour canary period
