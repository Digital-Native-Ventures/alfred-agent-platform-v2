# Phase 6 Completion Report

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Version**: v0.6.0-rc1  
**Date**: May 15, 2025  

## Overview

Phase 6 of the health check standardization project has been completed successfully, delivering two major components:

1. MSSQL Database Probe (Track 6A)
2. OpenTelemetry Tracing Support (Track 6B)

Track 6C (AI Orchestration PoC) has been deferred until after the core project wraps up.

## Deliverables

### Track 6A - MSSQL Probe

- ✅ Added MSSQL driver dependency to Go modules
- ✅ Created probe implementation in `internal/db/mssql.go`
- ✅ Added unit test scaffolding in `internal/db/mssql_test.go`
- ✅ Wired probe into CLI switch in `cmd/healthcheck/main.go`
- ✅ Added alert rules in `charts/alerts/mssql.yaml`
- ✅ Extended smoke-health compose file with MSSQL support
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/PROBES.md`

### Track 6B - OpenTelemetry Tracing

- ✅ Added OpenTelemetry dependencies to Go modules
- ✅ Created tracer bootstrap helper in `internal/trace/otel.go`
- ✅ Added CLI flags and environment variable support for tracing
- ✅ Wrapped each probe run in a span with service name, result, and error attributes
- ✅ Added local OpenTelemetry Collector setup for testing
- ✅ Created CI job for OpenTelemetry smoke testing
- ✅ Detailed documentation in `docs/TRACING.md`
- ✅ Added usage examples to README

## Testing & Verification

- All unit tests pass: `go test ./...`
- CI smoke tests pass for both MSSQL probe and OpenTelemetry tracing
- Binary size increase is minimal (only when tracing is enabled)
- Docker image builds successfully with new probes

## Design Choices

### MSSQL Probe
- Uses standard Microsoft SQL Server connection format
- Implements MSSQL-specific table creation and upsert patterns
- Follows the same metrics export pattern as other database probes

### OpenTelemetry Tracing
- Default-off, CLI-toggle design to keep binary lean
- Environment variable overrides for configuration flexibility
- Rich span attributes for correlation with service performance
- Compatible with any OTLP-compliant backend (Jaeger, Tempo, etc.)

## Migration Path

No breaking changes were introduced in this phase. The new features are completely opt-in:

1. MSSQL probe is only active when explicitly requested with `--db-type mssql`
2. Tracing is disabled by default and only enabled with `--trace-endpoint`

## Next Steps

- Monitor v0.6.0-rc1 during the 6-hour bake window
- Tag v0.6.0 final release if no issues are found
- Consider future enhancements:
  - Implement Track 6C (AI Orchestration PoC)
  - Add more database probes (MongoDB, Redis)
  - Support for additional OTLP export protocols (gRPC)

Phase 6 is now considered complete and the project is ready to move forward to the next phase.
