          Known CI Issues:
          
          1. lf-guard: The check has a bug where it filters filenames instead of content
             - It looks for literal 'LF' in Python files
             - Should exclude files containing ALFRED or SELF
             - Current implementation filters incorrectly
          
          2. check-no-site-pkgs: Expects dev/Dockerfile which doesn't exist
             - The job should gracefully handle missing Dockerfile
             - Currently fails when dev/Dockerfile is not present
          
          These issues affect all PRs, not just documentation PRs.
          The proper fix is to update the CI workflow in main branch.
