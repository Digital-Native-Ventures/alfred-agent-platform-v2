## Next Steps Action Plan

### Phase 1: Complete v3.0.1 Patch (Priority: HIGH)

1. **‚úÖ COMPLETED: Fixed contact-ingest health check**
   - Added curl to Dockerfile
   - Built and pushed contact-ingest:v3.0.1
   - Branch: fix/contact-ingest-imports-591 (ready to merge)

2. **Merge PR #589 and build crm-sync:v3.0.1**
   ```bash
   # After merge:
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
     -t ghcr.io/digital-native-ventures/alfred-agent-platform-v2/crm-sync:v3.0.1 \
     --push -f services/crm-sync/Dockerfile .
   ```

3. **Test v3.0.1 stack locally**
   ```bash
   TAG=v3.0.1 docker compose up -d \
     agent-core agent-bizdev contact-ingest slack-adapter crm-sync db-metrics
   ```

4. **Tag and release v3.0.1**
   ```bash
   git tag -a v3.0.1 -m "Patch release: Fix import errors in multiple services"
   git push origin v3.0.1
   ```

### Phase 2: Update GA Workflow (Priority: MEDIUM)

1. **Add missing services to docker-release.yml**
   - ui-chat
   - ui-admin
   - agent-atlas
   - hubspot-mock
   - model-registry
   - model-router

2. **Create PR for workflow updates**

### Phase 3: Full Stack Validation (Priority: HIGH)

1. **Deploy to staging with v3.0.1**
   ```bash
   helm upgrade alfred-staging ./charts/alfred \
     --set global.image.tag=v3.0.1 \
     --namespace staging
   ```

2. **Run smoke tests**
   - Health endpoints
   - Basic API functionality
   - Inter-service communication

3. **Monitor for 30 minutes**
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify metrics collection
   - Test alert firing

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (Priority: CRITICAL)

1. **Create deployment checklist**
2. **Schedule maintenance window**
3. **Deploy v3.0.1 to production**
4. **Post-deployment verification**

## Service Status Matrix

| Service | v3.0.0 Status | v3.0.1 Status | Action Required |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| agent-core | ‚úÖ Built | ‚úÖ Built | None |
| agent-bizops | ‚ùå Import error | ‚úÖ Fixed & Built | Merge PR #592 |
| contact-ingest | ‚ùå Module error | ‚úÖ Fixed & Built | Merge PR #593 |
| crm-sync | ‚ùå Circular import | üîÑ PR #589 | Merge and build |
| slack-adapter | ‚úÖ Built | ‚úÖ Built | None |
| db-metrics | ‚úÖ Built | ‚úÖ Built | None |
| ui-chat | ‚ùå Not in workflow | - | Add to workflow |

## Risk Assessment

1. **High Risk**: crm-sync circular import blocking CRM functionality
2. **Medium Risk**: Health checks failing may trigger false alerts
3. **Low Risk**: Missing services from workflow (can be built manually)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All GA services passing health checks
- [ ] No import errors in logs
- [ ] Staging deployment stable for 1 hour
- [ ] Prometheus metrics being collected
- [ ] Slack integration functional

## Timeline

- **Today**: Complete v3.0.1 patches, test locally
- **Tomorrow**: Deploy to staging, monitor
- **Day 3**: Production deployment
