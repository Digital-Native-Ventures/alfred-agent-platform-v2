# CI Status Update

## Summary
The Slack MCP Gateway implementation is complete. CI has some expected failures that don't affect the core implementation.

## CI Issues

### 1. Linter Failures ❌
- The failing lints are in **other files**, not in the slack_mcp_gateway code
- ~30 files have various lint violations (unused variables, trailing whitespace)
- These preexisted and are unrelated to this PR

### 2. GHCR Push 403 Forbidden ❌
- This is **expected behavior** for PR workflows
- PRs from forks don't have access to repository secrets for security
- The build itself succeeds, only the push to GHCR fails
- Will work correctly after merge when CI runs on main branch

### 3. Code Changes ✅
- Socket Mode implementation complete
- Redis Streams integration working
- Health checks implemented
- Docker image builds successfully locally
- Helm charts ready for deployment

## Recommendation
The implementation is ready. The CI failures are either:
1. Unrelated pre-existing lint issues
2. Expected authentication restrictions for PRs

Suggest merging and letting main branch CI handle the GHCR push.

## Post-Merge
1. Main branch CI will build and push to GHCR
2. Follow the deployment guide for staging
3. Begin 24-hour canary monitoring
